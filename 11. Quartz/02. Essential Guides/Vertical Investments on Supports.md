This eidolon alone should be at minimum a ~65% Increase in DMG dealt to enemies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Ruan Mei          | Eidolon 1  <br>While the Ultimate is active, all allies will ignore 20% of the enemies’ DEF when dealing damage.<br><br>Eidolon 2<br><br>When Ruan Mei is alive in-battle, all allies’ ATK is increased by 40% when dealing damage to weakness broken enemies.<br><br>Eidolon 4<br><br>When an enemy target gets weakness broken, Ruan Mei’s Break Effect increases by 100% for 3 turns. Buffs get applied before damage instances so the Talent’s Break DMG will also benefit from this light cone.  <br>  <br>Eidolon 6<br><br>Ruan Mei’s Talent Break DMG multiplier increases by 200%  <br>  <br>The Ultimate’s duration is increased by 1 turn, from 2 to 3, now having 100% up-time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | E1 <br><br>20% DEF Ignore with basically a 100% up-time can be anywhere from a ~12% DMG Increase to a ~23% DMG Increase, depending on how much DEF Shred/Ignore you already have stacked up.  <br><br>E2<br><br>This Eidolon may seem helpful but in practice is rarely useful, as most of the time the damage you will deal will be when the enemy isn’t weakness broken.  <br>  <br>This Eidolon also doesn’t increase Firefly’s actual ATK stat, meaning it doesn’t increase her Break Effect stat either, so her damage won’t be increased by this eidolon at all.  <br><br>E4<br><br>This Eidolon is a pretty nice increase to Ruan Mei’s damage, but this damage only really becomes relevant at E6.  <br>  <br>The buff can somewhat be used as a way to reduce Ruan Mei’s Break Effect requirement to max her skill’s DMG Bonus, but it won’t always be active.  <br>  <br>  <br>E6  <br>The duration increase is helpful to guarantee 100% up-time on the Ultimate’s RES Penetration buff.  <br>  <br>The Break DMG multiplier increase makes it now deal a good amount of damage. However, in most higher Eidolon investment teams, enemies will die before they can get weakness broken, making this half of the eidolon’s effect useless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Bronya            | Eidolon 1  <br>When using the Skill, there is a 50% fixed chance of recovering 1 skill point.  <br>  <br>This effect can only be triggered again after 2 turns.  <br>  <br>  <br>Eidolon 2  <br>After using Skill on an ally and having them take action, their SPD is increased by 30%.  <br>  <br>  <br>Eidolon 4  <br>After any ally other than Bronya uses their Basic ATK against an enemy weak to the Wind element, Bronya will immediately initiate a Follow-up Attack against the main target of the Basic ATK, dealing DMG equal to 80% of her Basic ATK DMG.  <br>  <br>This effect can only be triggered 1 time for every Bronya turn.  <br>  <br>  <br>Eidolon 6  <br>The Skill’s DMG Boosting effect placed on the target ally has its duration increased by 1 turn.                                                                                                                                                                      | E1  <br>This Eidolon helps Bronya a good amount, making what is a very skill point negative support into a less-so skill point negative support.  <br>  <br>Most team compositions that use Bronya really want her to have this Eidolon.  <br>  <br>  <br>E2  <br>This Eidolons allows most damage dealers that otherwise want to use SPD main stat boots now able to use ATK, HP or DEF ones to increase their damage.  <br>  <br>The units that can’t make use of this Eidolon currently are only 1 in number, namely Jingliu.  <br>Uing Jingliu’s technique before starting the battle, the first time she uses her skill will make her enter the “Spectral” state and have her next action brought forward by 100%.  <br>This 100% Action Forward makes her lose the SPD buff instantly, which makes her unable to switch to ATK boots to increase her damage. One way it does help is making her easily reach 160 SPD to max the effects of 2pc Firmament Frontline: Glamoth.  <br>  <br>Otherwise, this Eidolon doesn’t mess up speed tuning with the damage dealer. Though it may be less than welcome in situations where you want other allies to be tuned to the damage dealer, but these can just be fixed by changing SPD.  <br>  <br>  <br>E4  <br>This Eidolon’s effect exists purely to proc Robin’s Additional DMG and as extra stacks for Feixiao to use, which it’s very good at doing.  <br>  <br>  <br>E6  <br>This Eidolon increases Bronya’s performance in FuA teams by a decent bit. |
| Black Swan        | Eidolon 1 While Black Swan is alive in-battle, enemies afflicted with Wind Shear, Bleed, Burn, or Shock will have their corresponding Wind, Physical, Fire, or Lightning elemental RES respectively reduced by 25%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | E1 25% RES Shred is rather huge for an Eidolon 1 and would have been the best E1 in the game, had it not been restricted by requiring enemies to be inflicted by a DoT.  <br>  <br>Can be useful in some cases, triggering the E1’s effect using Kafka’s signature Light Cone as it can apply a shock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
