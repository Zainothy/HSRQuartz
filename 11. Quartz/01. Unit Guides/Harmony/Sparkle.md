## 1. Short Overview: 

> [!context] Sparkle: 
> **Base Stats:**
>    HP = 1397      DEF = 485      ATK = 524      SPD = 101
### **Info:**
Sparkle is a Harmony Path character that is able to advance forward another ally's action with her skill, while providing a strong Crit. DMG to the ally and a medium DMG% buff as well as a small ATK% buff to all allies.
One of the key points to note is her Ultimate, as it's able to make Sparkle effectively be skill point-positive over 3 turns with its somewhat cheap cost, even when constantly using your skill.
She is best utilized in team compositions that make use of every part of her kit[^1]. 

>[!tip] Kit TLDR: 
>- **Skill:** Increases Crit. DMG of an ally by 24% of Sparkle's Crit. DMG + a flat 45% for 1 turn. Advances forward the target ally by 50%.
>- **Talent:** Maximum Skill Points increases by 2, from 5 to 7, and whenever an ally consumes a Skill Point they get a 6% DMG Bonus buff, stacking up to 3 times.
>- **Ultimate:** Recovers 4 Skill Points and provides allies with 'Cipher'. Cipher increases the DMG Bonus of Sparkles Talent by 10% for each stack, for a total of 48% DMG Bonus.
>- **Technique:**
> 	In the Over-world, allies gain ‘Misdirect’ for 20 seconds and cannot be spotted by enemies
> 	At the start of battle, 3 Skill Points are recovered. 
>- **Ascension-locked Ability Traces:** 
>	A2: Basic Attack regenerates 10 additional energy, the same amount of energy as the skill. 
>	A4: Skill's Crit. DMG buff now lasts until the start of the ally's second turn.
>	A6: 15% ATK for all allies. For every 1/2/3 quantum type allies on the team including Sparkle, Quantum-Type allies' ATK increases by an additional 5%/15%/30%
>- **Stat Bonus Traces:**
>  24% Crit. DMG, 28% HP, 18% Effect RES

## 2. How to Play 
### Skill Points
>[!tip] Skill Point Economy: 
>Sparkle's Ultimate regenerates enough skill points so that Sparkle can be skill point positive over a 3 turn rotation. Because of that, you pretty much just want to use it whenever you get it.
Make sure to use Sparkle's Ultimate before you use Sparkle's Skill if you get Sparkle's Ultimate right before Sparkle's turn or during it, so that you don't waste the skill's Energy Generation.
### Action Forward 
Now, for characters that can Advance Forward other units' action/turn like Sparkle can, what you will want to know and watch out for is:
When it is best to use the AF ability
What ally to target with the ability
What SPD to build on your Action Advancer (in this case Sparkle) and Damage Dealer, to most efficiently make use of their AF amount.

Sparkle's AF comes from her Skill, so it's always best to just use it whenever it's Sparkle's turn as her basic attack doesn't do much of anything.

The ally you will want to target will 99.99% of the time be your Damage Dealer. Those 0.01% of cases include times when:
Enemies are somewhat low HP, but not low enough to kill them without Robin's ultimate being active and Sparkle's turn is up, you would want to use Sparkle's skill on Robin to have use her Ultimate and end the battle quicker, potentially saving a cycle.

The Speed you will want to build on your Sparkle will basically be that of the highest speed break point you can achieve, as Sparkle's Action Forward amount is only 50%. Compared to a unit with 100% Action Forward or immediate action, you are wasting AV waiting for the Damage dealer to act first before Sparkle can AF them; on top of having that first turn NOT buffed by Sparkle. 
For most people, 160 SPD will be somewhat achievable and is a good speed break point to aim for.
However, if you have a Superimposition 5 Dance! Dance! Dance! light cone, for just 8 more SPD than that at 168 SPD on the 4-Pc Eagle of Twilight Line set you can effectively achieve the 200 SPD break point, with 3 turns in the first cycle and 2 turns every cycle afterwards. For reference 134 SPD is only 2 turns in the first cycle, with every cycle afterward besides 1 having her only get 1 turn each. View speed information [[../../02. Essential Guides/Speed Fundamentals#Thresholds|here]].

## 3. RGM Relevancy:
**Memory of Chaos, Pure Fiction and Apocalyptic Shadow**
>[!warning] RGM Notes: 
> All Harmony path characters' relevancy in end-game content will depend on the teams they can effectively fit in. A lot more often than not, the teams they can fit in include teams for all 3 game modes. This is another reason as to why their value for an account is so high.

## 4. Team Compositions & Synergies: 
Sparkle works best when your damage dealer doesn't want to build any speed and are able to fully make use of her buffs and skill point positive-ness.
Sparkle's Action Forward is only 50%, which doesn't allow her to be used like Bronya by giving a unit a second turn. Instead, she can act as the damage dealer's speed, bringing her up to her action value.

>[!tip] Where to use Sparkle? 
>**Units that Sparkle synergizes with:** Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae and Qingque. Sparkle provides them with valuable buffs and with skill points for them to use with their skill.
>
>**Damage Dealers used with Sparkle:** Seele, Acheron, Argenti, Jing Yuan, Clara, Yunli, Jade, Xueyi, Herta and Himeko. In some rare cases, she can also be used with Feixiao.
>She can also be used with Blade, Dr. Ratio and Feixiao, but isn't advised to unless you don't have the other better supports that these units can use or they aren't available as they are currently being used on the other team.

### Team Compositions 
We will be giving you some examples of good and at least somewhat comfortable teams that you can use with Sparkle. For more details on how to play the teams, please check out the Damage Dealer's guide.

## 5. Trace Levelling Priority 
**Skill>Ultimate>Talent**
**All Ascension-locked Abilities Traces are important and must be unlocked.**
- Unlock Crit. DMG stat bonus traces first, but eventually all.
- Don't level up the basic attack.

## 6. Light Cone Rankings 
### 1. **Earthly Escapade**
**Sparkle's Signature 5★ Light Cone**
>[!context] Light Cone Effect
>The wearer's Crit. DMG is increased by 32%
At the start of battle as well as for every 4 skill points the wearer recovers, all allies' Crit. Rate and Crit. DMG gets increased by 10% and 28% respectively, for 4 turns

This Signature LC might seem incredible at first, but in actuality it's only a small upgrade over other options, unless the team you're using Sparkle in is one where damage is primarily dealt out-side Damage Dealers' turn.
### 2. **But the Battle Isn't Over**
**Bronya's Signature 5★ Light Cone**
>[!context] Light Cone Effect
>The Wearer's ERR is increased by 10%. 
>The wearer's first Ultimate and every other one following it regenerates 1 Skill Point for the team.
>When using skill, the target ally gets buffed with 30% Damage Bonus for 1 turn. 

The ERR is useless in 99.9% of cases.
Extra SP Generation is welcome for some teams and DMG Bonus buff is decent, although it only lasts for 1 turn, making it *not* apply for Follow-up Attacks.
### 3. **Dance! Dance! Dance!**
**Gacha 4★ Light Cone**
>[!context] Light Cone Effect
>
Advances forward all allies' action by 16-24% when the wearer uses their ultimate.

This effect is very useful if you know how to make use of it, but less so if you don't. We won't get into the specifics of it in this section.
Sparkle can very easily achieve a 3 Turn Ultimate rotation by just using ERR main stat link rope, making this light cone's effect consistent on her.
### 4. **Past and Future S5**
**Free 4★ Light Cone**
>[!context] After using Skill on a target ally, buffs them with 16-32% Damage Bonus for 1 turn.

DMG Bonus buff is useful. If you're using a Quantum Element Damage Dealer, it is likely better for you to use Planetary Rendezvous instead, as its effect is permanent.
### 5. **Planetary Rendezvous**
**Gacha 4★ Light Cone**
>[!context] Allies of the same Element Type as the wearer get buffed with 12-24% DMG Bonus permanently.

>[!warning] Only use with a Quantum Element Damage Dealer.
 
 Permanent DMG Bonus buff, making it active for all damage types that the wearer can deal. Be it their Skill, Ultimate, Follow-up Attack, DoT or even their Summon.
 
## 7. Relic Main and Subsidiary Stats
#### Main Stats:
**Boots**: SPD
**Body:** Crit. DMG
**Sphere**: HP / DEF
**Link Rope**: Energy Regeneration Rate% 
#### Subsidiary Stats Priority
1. **SPD** Until you hit your desired break point.
2. **Crit. DMG%** As much as possible.
3. **HP%/DEF%** 
4. **Effect Resistance%**
## 8. Relic and Planar Ornament Sets
#### **Relic Sets**  
- **Eagle of Twilight Line**: 24% Advance to wearer on ultimate (The 4-piece set effect specifically). This is extremely useful for 0c AND normal runs but we don't expect you to run this set as it can be inefficient to farm.

- **Sacredos’ Relived Ordeal (4 Piece):** This set is useful in amplifying your damage dealer's damage a good amount and helping your Sparkle achieve speed break points easier. Sparkle can stack up the set's effect, by not letting the damage dealer take a turn out-side of those given by Sparkle and due to its turn duration resetting with every activation.
	- Increases Speed by 6%
	- When using Skill or Ultimate on one ally target, increases the ability target's CRIT DMG by **18%**, lasting for **2** turn(s). This effect can stack up to **2** time(s).
TLDR: Eagle is best when trying to achieve specific speed tuning breakpoints, 3 turn Sparkle for example. Sacerdos is the best general purpose set, providing a Speed stat stick and good damage amp. 
#### **Planar Ornament Sets**
The difference in buffing capability isn't that big and Sparkle doesn't care for extra ERR, so just use the set that you happened to get the best stats on while grinding for other sets like Bananamusement or Rutilant Arena.

1. **Lushaka, the Sunken Seas**: Increases the wearer’s ERR by 5% and increases the ATK of the first character in the party line-up (besides the wearer) by 12%. Best set for pure amp, however Vonwaq or Forge may be wanted for specific breakpoints.

3. **Broken Keel** Provides 10% Crit DMG buff for all teammates. Best for teams with a crit scaling damage dealer. Make sure to get effect resistance substats to proc its effect.

4. **Fleet of the Ageless** Provides 12% ATK buff to all teammates. Best for DoT teams.

5. **Sprightly Vonwacq** Advances Sparkle's action forward by 40% at the start of battle. Action forward is useful but can be a bad set to use if you have other allies that need their turn to come up before the damage dealer's to give their buffs (like Tingyun), unless you also increase those supports' speed.

6. **Penacony, Land of the Dreams** Provides 10% DMG bonus buff to all other allies of the same element as the wearer. Only use with a quantum element damage dealer.

7. **Forge of the Kalpagni Lantern** Just a 6% speed buff.

## 9. Stat Goals
- 200+ Crit. DMG. If you have her signature light cone, aim for 250+ Crit. DMG.
- Try to effectively hit 200 SPD with one of the break points here [[#10. Speed Tuning]].
  If you can't achieve that, try hitting **153.9 Speed** `OR` **138.5 SPD** `OR` **169.3 SPD**. 
##### With HP main stat sphere:
**4400+ HP  1100+ DEF** 
- If you're using a 5★ Light Cone, then aim for **5000+ HP** and **1200+ DEF** instead.
##### With DEF main stat sphere:
**3500+ HP**  **1500+ DEF**
- Using a 5★ LC, aim for **4000+ HP** and **1700+ DEF** instead.

### **Notes:**
- 169.3, 153.9 and 138.5 SPD are speed break points, check out what they are useful for **[[../../02. Essential Guides/Speed Fundamentals#Thresholds| here]]** and check out character's decimal speed [here](Https://enka.network)

- If you have any teammates that **permanently** buff speed (like Ruan Mei), make sure to lower your speed accordingly as more speed than required for a break point is rarely useful.
	- If you have sources of action advance, such as DDD or 4 Piece eagle, and wish to know how much speed you need: please consult [[../../02. Essential Guides/Speed Fundamentals#Relevant Breakpoints|the relevant breakpoints]].

## 10. Speed Tuning
**Here are some breakpoints for effective 200 SPD (3 Turn) Sparkle:**
*If not listed here consult [[../../02. Essential Guides/Speed Fundamentals#Relevant Breakpoints| Relevant breakpoint list]]*. If still not listed, calculation required. 
You can check your character's SPD numbers with 3 decimals by holding your cursor over the number (or holding your finger over it on mobile) at [https://enka.network]().

- **189.9**: with Ruan Mei
- **183.334**: with 4-piece Eagle of Twilight Line
- **184**: with S5 Dance! Dance! Dance! (DDD)
- **173.334**: with Eagle and Ruan Mei
- **174**: with S5 DDD and Ruan Mei 
- **178**: with E1 Huohuo and Ruan Mei
- **168**: with 2 S5 DDD procs 
- **167**: with 2 Eagle procs **OR** One Eagle + One S5 DDD
- **158**: with 2 S5 DDD procs and Ruan Mei
- **157**: with 2 Eagle procs and Ruan Mei

## 11. Eidolons Run Down: 

##### **Eidolon 2**
Every stack of the talent now additionally allows allies to ignore 8% of the enemy's defense when attacking, up to 3 times. 24% defense shred/ignore is quite huge.
##### **Eidolon 6**
The Crit. DMG buff provided by the skill additionally increases by 30% of Sparkle's Crit. DMG and the skill's Crit. DMG buff now extends to all allies with 'Cipher', making it a team-wide buff pretty much permanently. A huge increase for dual dps and triple dps teams, but not so much for hypercarry.
##### **Eidolon 1**
The Cipher effect given by the ultimate lasts for 1 more turn and all allies with the effect have their ATK increased by 40%. A pretty nice buff.
##### **Eidolon 4**
The ultimate recovers 1 more skill point and the upper cap of skill points also increases by 1. Only useful for super skill point-intensive teams.


[^1]: **Hypercarry:** A team where every member is designed to support the DPS, for example: Yunli, Sparkle, Robin and Tingyun is a hypercarrry. With every teammate having the purpose of providing for the DPS.
