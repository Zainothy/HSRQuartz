## 1. Short Overview: 

> [!context] Sparkle: 
> **Base Stats:**
> HP = 1397        DEF = 485        ATK = 524        SPD = 101**
> 

### **Info:**
Sparkle is a Crit damage scaling Harmony advancer, she provides strong Crit DMG and DMG% buffs to her team, along with being completely SP neutral. She is best utilised in hypercarry team compositions [^1]. 
>[!tip] Kit TLDR: 
>- **Skill:** Increases Crit DMG of an ally by 24% of hers + 45% for 1 turn. Advances forward chosen ally by 50%
>- **Talent:** Increases number of Skill points by two, all allies DMG% increases by 6% for every SP used. Stacks three times
>- **Ultimate:** Recovers 4 skill points, provides Cipher: which increases each stack of Sparkles Talent by 10%. Meaning that when fully stacked with Cipher, the team can gain up to48% damage boost.
>- **Technique:** Allies provided with ‘misdirect’ for 20 secs: all allies cannot be spotted by enemies, 3 SP recovered on battle start. 
>- **Traces:** 
>	A2: Basic attack regens same amount of energy as skill, 
>	A4: duration for skill buff increased by 1 turn
>	A6: 15% ATK, for every 1/2/3 quantum type allies damage increases by 5/15/30%

## 2. How to Play 
### Skill Points
>[!tip] SP Economu: 
>Sparkle's Ultimate regenerates enough skill points so that Sparkle can be skill point positive over a 3 turn rotation. Because of that, you pretty much just want to use it whenever you get it.
Make sure to use Sparkle's Ultimate before you use Sparkle's Skill if you get Sparkle's Ultimate right before Sparkle's turn or during it, so that you don't waste the skill's Energy Generation.
### Action Forward 
Now, for characters that can Advance Forward other units' action/turn like Sparkle can, what you will want to know and watch out for is:
When it is best to use the AF ability
What ally to target with the ability
What SPD to build on your Action Advancer (in this case Sparkle) and Damage Dealer, to most efficiently make use of their AF amount.

Sparkle's AF comes from her Skill, so it's always best to just use it whenever it's Sparkle's turn as her basic attack doesn't do much of anything.

The ally you will want to target will 99.99% of the time be your Damage Dealer. Those 0.01% of cases include times when:
Enemies are somewhat low HP, but not low enough to kill them without Robin's ultimate being active and Sparkle's turn is up, you would want to use Sparkle's skill on Robin to have use her Ultimate and end the battle quicker, potentially saving a cycle.

The Speed you will want to build on your Sparkle will basically be that of the highest speed break point you can achieve, as Sparkle's Action Forward amount is only 50%. Compared to a unit with 100% Action Forward or immediate action, you are wasting AV waiting for the Damage dealer to act first before Sparkle can AF them; on top of having that first turn NOT buffed by Sparkle. 
For most people, 160 SPD will be somewhat achievable and is a good speed break point to aim for.
However, if you have a Superimposition 5 Dance! Dance! Dance! light cone, for just 8 more SPD than that at 168 SPD on the 4-Pc Eagle of Twilight Line set you can effectively achieve the 200 SPD break point, with 3 turns in the first cycle and 2 turns every cycle afterwards. For reference 134 SPD is only 2 turns in the first cycle, with every cycle afterward besides 1 having her only get 1 turn each. View speed information[[../../02. Essential Guides/Speed Fundamentals#Thresholds| here]]
## 3. RGM Relevancy:
**Memory of Chaos, Pure Fiction and Apocalyptic Shadow**


>[!warning] RGM Notes: 
> All Harmony path characters' relevancy in end-game content will depend on the teams they can effectively fit in. A lot more often than not, the teams they can fit in include teams for all 3 game modes. This is another reason as to why their value for an account is so high.

## 4. Team Compositions & Synergies: 
>[!tip] Where to use? 
>Sparkle works best when your damage dealer doesn't want to build any speed and are able to fully make use of her buffs.
That is because the ideal way you speed tune most teams with Sparkle is by having her act as the damage dealer's speed, bringing her up to her action value.
> - She also works really well in teams that are rather skill point intensive, as she herself is over-all skill point positive in her rotation.
	
**Sparkle is most commonly used along:** Seele, Acheron, Argenti, Jing Yuan, Clara, Yunli and Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae. She can also be used with Blade and Dr. Ratio, though worse than using a Bronya for Blade or a Tingyun for Dr. Ratio.
## 5. Trace Priority: 
Skill>Ultimate>Talent 

**All ascension passive abilities are important and must be unlocked.**

- Unlock stat bonus traces as you see fit.

- Don't level up the basic attack.
## 6. Light Cone Rankings 
### 1. **Earthly Escapade** (Sparkle's Signature 5★ Light Cone)

Increases the wearer's Crit. DMG by 32% and at the start of battle as well as for every 4 skill points the wearer recovers, all allies' Crit. Rate and Crit. DMG gets increased by 10% and 28% respectively, for 4 turns.

### 2. **But the Battle Isn't Over** (Bronya's Signature 5★ Light Cone)

Makes the wearer's first ultimate and every other ultimate after that regenerate a skill point and gives the ally Sparkle uses her skill on 30% damage bonus buff for 1 turn. The ERR buff isn't too useful.
### 3. **Dance! Dance! Dance!** (Gacha 4★  Light Cone)

Advances forward all allies' turns by 24% at superimposition 5 when the wearer uses their ultimate. Due to the fact that Sparkle has no energy issues whatsoever, this is a very easy light cone to use on her. However, if you don't have it at a high superimposition then it may not even be worth building around to make use of it.
### 4. **Past and Future S5** (Free 4★ Light Cone)

Gives the ally Sparkle uses her skill on 32% damage bonus buff for 1 turn.
### 5. **Planetary Rendezvous** (Gacha 4★ Light Cone)

Gives allies of the same element type as the wearer 12% to 24% dmg bonus buff permanently. Only use with a quantum element damage dealer. 
 
## 7. **Relics Main and Subsidiary Stats:**

#### Main Stats:
**Feet (Boots)**: SPD

**Sphere**: HP% = DEF%

**Link Rope**: Energy Regeneration Rate% (ERR)

#### Subsidiary Stats Priority
1. **Speed:** Until desired break point.

2. **Crit. DMG%:** As much as possible

3. **HP%/DEF%** 

4. **Effect resistance**
## 8. Relics Sets and Planar Ornament Sets
### **Relic Sets:**  

- **Eagle of Twilight Line**: 24% Advance to wearer on ultimate (The 4-piece set effect specifically). This is extremely useful for 0c AND normal runs but we don't expect you to run this set as it can be inefficient to farm.

- **Sacredos’ Relived Ordeal (4 Piece):** This set is useful in amplifying your damage dealer's damage a good amount and helping your Sparkle achieve speed break points easier. Sparkle can stack up the set's effect, by not letting the damage dealer take a turn out-side of those given by Sparkle and due to its turn duration resetting with every activation.
	- Increases Speed by 6%
	- When using Skill or Ultimate on one ally target, increases the ability target's CRIT DMG by **18%**, lasting for **2** turn(s). This effect can stack up to **2** time(s).
	- 
TLDR: Eagle is best when trying to achieve specific speed tuning breakpoints, 3 turn Sparkle for example. Sacredos is the best general purpose set, providing a Speed stat stick and good damage amp. 
### **Planar Ornament Set:**
The difference isn't too significant.

1. **Lushaka, the Sunken Seas**: Increases the wearer’s ERR by 5% and increases the ATK of the first character in the party line-up (besides the wearer) by 12%. Best set for pure amp, however Vonwaq or Forge may be wanted for specific breakpoints.

3. **Broken Keel** Provides 10% Crit DMG buff for all teammates. Best for teams with a crit scaling damage dealer. Make sure to get effect resistance substats to proc its effect.

4. **Fleet of the Ageless** Provides 12% ATK buff to all teammates. Best for DoT teams.

5. **Sprightly Vonwacq** Advances Sparkle's action forward by 40% at the start of battle. Action forward is useful but can be a bad set to use if you have other allies that need their turn to come up before the damage dealer's to give their buffs (like Tingyun), unless you also increase those supports' speed.

6. **Penacony, Land of the Dreams** Provides 10% DMG bonus buff to all other allies of the same element as the wearer. Only use with a quantum element damage dealer.

7. **Forge of the Kalpagni Lantern** Just a 6% speed buff.

## **9. Stat Goals:**
- 200+ Crit. DMG

- **153.9 Speed** `OR` **138.5 SPD** `OR` **169.3 SPD** 

- If you have her signature light cone, aim for 250+ Crit. DMG.
  
### With HP main stat sphere:

**4400 HP, 1100 DEF** 
- If you're using a 5★ Light Cone, then aim for **5000+ HP** and **1200+ DEF** instead.

###  With DEF main stat sphere:

**3500+ HP**, **1500+ DEF**
- If you're using a 5★ Light Cone, then aim for **4000+ HP** and **1700+ DEF** instead.

### **Notes:**
- 169.3, 153.9 and 138.5 SPD are speed break points, check out what they are useful for **[[../../02. Essential Guides/Speed Fundamentals#Thresholds| here]]** and check out character's decimal speed [here](Https://enka.network)

- If you have any teammates that **permanently** buff speed (like Ruan Mei), make sure to lower your speed accordingly as more speed than required for a break point is rarely useful.
	- If you have sources of action advance, such as DDD or 4 Piece eagle, and wish to know how much speed you need: please consult [[../../02. Essential Guides/Speed Fundamentals#Relevant Breakpoints|the relevant breakpoints]]




## 10. Speed Tuning:

**Here are some breakpoints for effective 200 SPD (3 Turn) Sparkle:**
*If not listed here consult [[../../02. Essential Guides/Speed Fundamentals#Relevant Breakpoints| Relevant breakpoint list]]*. If still not listed, calculation required. 

- **189.9**: with Ruan Mei

- **183.4**: with 4-piece Eagle of Twilight Line

- **184**: with S5 Dance! Dance! Dance! (DDD)

- **173.4**: with Eagle and Ruan Mei

- **174**: with S5 DDD and Ruan Mei 

- **178**: with E1 Huohuo and Ruan Mei

- **168**: with 2 S5 DDD procs 

- **167**: with 2 Eagle procs **OR** One Eagle + One S5 DDD

- **158**: with 2 S5 DDD procs and Ruan Mei

- **157**: with 2 Eagle procs and Ruan Mei

## 11. Eidolons Run Down: 

1. **Eidolon 2** Every stack of the talent now additionally allows allies to ignore 8% of the enemy's defense when attacking, up to 3 times. 24% defense shred/ignore is quite huge.

2. **Eidolon 6** The Crit. DMG buff provided by the skill additionally increases by 30% of Sparkle's Crit. DMG and the skill's Crit. DMG buff now extends to all allies with 'Cipher', making it a team-wide buff pretty much permanently. A huge increase for dual dps and triple dps teams, but not so much for hypercarry.

3. **Eidolon 1** The Cipher effect given by the ultimate lasts for 1 more turn and all allies with the effect have their ATK increased by 40%. A pretty nice buff.

4. **Eidolon 4** The ultimate recovers 1 more skill point and the upper cap of skill points also increases by 1. Only useful for super skill point-intensive teams.




[^1]: **Hypercarry:** A team where every member is designed to support the DPS, for example: Yunli, Sparkle, Robin and Tingyun is a hypercarrry. With every teammate having the purpose of providing for the DPS.
