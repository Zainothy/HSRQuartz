## 1. Short Overview: 
>[!context] Ruan Mei: 
>**Base Stats (Level 80):**
>HP   = 1087        ATK  = 660
>DEF = 485         SPD = 104

### **Info:**

Ruan Mei is a Harmony Path character that is able to provide consistent buffs to all allies, including: DMG Bonus, RES Penetration and Weakness Break Efficiency, as well as 10% Speed. Additionally, she delays the enemies' next action further after their weakness is broken and deals a bit of damage when doing so.

These aspects of her kit make her integral to the break archetype as a whole, and a very strong support for traditional DPS comps too. 

>[!error] Slow or Fast?
>Building Ruan Mei slow has the benefit of having her ultimate be permanently active, as compared to a fast build where you have a bit of down-time.
>
>This "Permanent Up-time" for her Ultimate is only for 0 cycle clears however, and even for 0 cycle clears it can become non-permanent due to things like Robin's Ultimate or enemies advancing allies forward.
>
>Both builds have their flaws. The difference between the two is that the slow build is catered more towards 0 cycle clears, while the other one is not and has a wider application range.
You should decide for yourself which of the two to use, based on how fast you aim to clear. (edited)

## 2. How to Play: 



## 3. RGM Relevancy: 
**Memory of Chaos, Pure Fiction and Apocalyptic Shadow**
>[!warning] RGM Notes: 
>We preach this quite often, all Harmony characters’ relevancy in end-game content is highly dependent on the relevant teams and archetypes that they are capable of supporting. However, Harmony units typically always maintain some form of relevancy, despite what the meta may dictate. That being said, RM in the current meta primarily functions to support Break, and sometimes comps with multiple units dealing damage. With the Advent of Fugue, and the number of alternative non break teams that RM fits into. She is an incredibly high value pull, holding a valuable place in the majority of accounts. 

## 4. Team Compositions & Synergies: 
Ruan Mei is an incredibly versatile support, but thrives in two specific scenarios. Either when your team falls under that of the break archetype, or when you have a team with multiple members of the team doing damage and/or the majority of the party is able to reap the benefits of the teamwide nature of her buffs. 


>[!tip] Where to use RM? 
>**Examples of Synergy:** 
>- Boothill, Firefly and Rappa all rely on RM because of her resistance penetration, additional break damage and of course, her weakness break efficiency buffs. Which enable these units to break more frequently, and do significantly more damage because of the fact that break damage scales off of Toughness reduction. 
>
>>[!warning]
>>Please note that RM’s compositions are flexible, and NOT restricted to any of the following teams or any of the suggested synergies. She is an extremely versatile support, but shiness in specific areas where the whole team (or close to it) can benefit from her buffs.

## 5. Trace Levelling Priority
#### Ultimate>Skill>Talent
**Please note that all traces are beneficial to this unit, and we recommenced that all be maxxed and every ascension be unlocked**
- Prioritise Speed bonus traces, and then Break effect. **Ensure all are eventually unlocked**
- Ignore Basic Attack 

# 6. Light Cone Rankings: 
### 1. **Past Self in Mirror** 
![[../../Media/Past Self In The Mirror.png|200]]
>[!context] Light Cone Effect
>Increases the wearer's Break Effect by **60/70/80/90/100%**. After the wearer uses their Ultimate, increases all allies' DMG by **24/28/32/36/40%**, lasting for **3** turns. Should the wearer's Break Effect exceed or equal 150%, 1 Skill Point will be recovered. At the start of each wave, immediately regenerates **10/12.5/15/17.5/20** Energy for all allies. Effects of the same type cannot stack.

It provides the biggest amount of break effect out of any light cone, making Ruan Mei significantly easier to build. Along with this, it provides a monumential amount of utility, as it enables a number of ultimate rotations by giving energy to the entire team. SP is always valuable, improving rotations and SP economy. 

### 2. **Memories of The Past**
![[../../Media/Memories of The Past.png|200]]
>[!context] Light Cone Effect 
>Increases the wearer's Break Effect by **28/35/42/49/56%**. When the wearer attacks, additionally regenerates **4/5/6/7/8** Energy. This effect can only be triggered 1 time per turn.

Provides a decent amount of break effect, the second highest after signature. However, it requires S5 at the bare minimum in order to achieve a 3 turn ultimate rotation, which is necessary to keep 100% uptime. 

### 3. **Meshing Cogs**
![[../../Media/Meshing Cogs.png|200]]
>[!context] Light Cone Effect 
>After the wearer uses attacks or gets hit, additionally regenerates **4/5/6/7/8** Energy. This effect can only be triggered 1 time per turn.

Provides RM with good energy generation, and allows for a 3 turn ultimate rotation. However, it comes with the caveat of providing abysmal base stats. When running this cone, your RM lacking in defensive stats, and may die in some sustainless runs. 

## Relic Main and Subsidiary Stats: 
#### Main Stats:
**Boots:** SPD
**Body:** HP%/DEF%
**Sphere:** HP%/DEF%
**Link Rope:**
Slow Mei: Break Effect Rope 
Fast Mei: Energy Regeneration Rate% 
## 8. Relic and Planar Ornament Sets
#### **Relic Sets**
	There is no one definitive best choice, RM's relics are quite 
    dependent on the scenario 
##### **Watchmaker, Master Dream of Machinations** 
(4-Piece ONLY)
*When the wearer uses their Ultimate on an ally, Break Effect for all allies increases by **30%** for **2** turn(s). This effect cannot be stacked.*

This set is Ruan Mei’s best supporting set for break teams, and is ideal when it is not in use by Harmony MC. However, it doesn’t contribute anything to non-break comps, and is effectively useless if in use by other allies. 
##### **Iron Cavalry Against the Scourge** 
(4 Piece):
*If the wearer's Break Effect is 150% or higher, ignores **10%** of the enemy target's DEF when dealing Break DMG to them. When the wearer's Break Effect is 250% or higher, the Super Break DMG they deal to enemy targets additionally ignores **15%** of the targets' DEF.*
This set is Ruan Mei’s best set if looking to prioritise personal damage, only when in a superbreak team. The nature of SB teams allow basically everyone to do decent damage, and this set can enable that. Which is helpful in avoiding the 
dreaded 1%, and will probably be your best alternative if Harmony MC has Watchmaker

##### **2-Piece + 2-Piece Break Effect/Speed Combo:**
*A combination of 2pc sets that provide speed or break effect, e.g. Combining 2pc Cavalry (16% Break Effect) with 2pc sacredos (6% Speed).* 

These, as stated by the game: only provide stat bonuses. Which is helpful in hitting a desired breakpoint in speed or break effect, you will probably find yourself using this combination if you are not running Ruan Mei in a break team, and/or you want to hit the required stats more easily. 
#### **Planar Ornament Sets**
##### **Lushaka, the Sunken Seas**
*Increases the wearer's Energy Regeneration Rate by **5%**. If the wearer is not the first character in the team lineup, then increase the ATK of the first character in the team lineup by **12%**.* 

This is RM’s best supporting planar, generally. Specifically when looking to amplify one specific character a decent amount, suitable for hypercarry and can work with Firefly and Rappa, due to their ATK% to BE% conversion. However, it is not applicable for Break teams without that conversion. Furthermore, teams that don’t desire ATK% buffs. 
##### **Forge of The Kalpagni Lantern**
*Increase the wearer's SPD by **6%**. When the wearer hits enemy targets with Fire Weakness, the wearer's Break Effect increases by **40%**, lasting for **1** turn(s).*
  
This set is beneficial if it allows you to hit a certain break effect or speed threshold, providing nothing beyond that. Do note that if you are not running firefly, and are against non-fire weak enemies: you will not be able to take full advantage of this set. 
##### **Sprightly Vonwacq**
*Increases the wearer's Energy Regeneration Rate by **5%**. When the wearer's SPD reaches **120** or higher, the wearer's action is Advanced Forward by **40%** immediately upon entering battle.*

Enables certain ultimate rotations, and may be needed in order to achieve a 3 turn ultimate on Fast Mei. Along with this, it is **needed** to run Slow Mei, as it is the only way to have your ultimate up before the rest of your team takes action. Typically, you will be running either this or Lushaka on non-break teams, depending on if you are prioritising damage or utility. 
## 9. Stat Goals: 
- **Fast Mei:** 160+ Break Effect 
- **Slow Mei:** 250+ Break Effect 

##### HP Main Stats: 
- If using a 4★ Light Cone, aim for around **4200+ HP** and **1100-1200 DEF** 
- If using a 5★, aim for around **5000+ HP** and **1300+ DEF**
##### DEF Main Stats:
- For 4★ Light Cone, aim for around **3600+ HP** and **1500+ DEF**
- For 5★, aim for around **4000+ HP** and **1700-1800+ DEF**

*Further Speed Stats Listed in Section 10*

## 10. Speed Tuning: 
#### Slow Mei: 
Slow Mei speed tuning is quite self explanatory, however there is one breakpoint worth hitting: that is **120 Speed WITH Vonwacq**. If you don’t run Vonwaqc, no speed at all, keep her at base SPD. 
#### Fast Mei: 
This is entirely dependent on what you are trying to achieve, but for a general reference we will provide some breakpoints. *If you wish to investigate more specific breakpoints, consult [[../../02. Essential Guides/Turn-based Combat#Relevant Breakpoints|the relevant breakpoints]]. 

- **134 Speed:** Provides RM with two actions within the the 0th Cycle 
- **160 Speed:** 2 Actions withing cycle 0, along with the ability to outspeed most elites and keep up with the team. 
- **Effective 200 Speed:** RM doesn’t usually want to run at effective 200, however it can prove useful in very specific scenarios. 200 Speed provides three actions to RM, within cycle 0. The breakpoints for effective 200 in certain scenarios can be found [[[../../02. Essential Guides/Turn-based Combat#Relevant Breakpoints|here]]. 
## 11. Eidolons Breakdown: 
##### **Eidolon 1**
	Neuronic Embroidery: While the Ultimate's field is deployed, 
    the DMG dealt by all allies ignores **20%** of the target's DEF.
This is Ruan Mei’s most notable Eidolon, providing a noticeable damage increase to the party on it’s own. However it is most effective when stacked with DEF ignore, due to the exponential nature of the damage boost that DEF ignore provides. Overall, this Eidolon is worthwhile, however the utility S1 provides can be more beneficial in many scenarios. This is especially true when the team is lacking DEF ignore from other sources. 
![[../../Media/Def Shred Graph.png|Credit: Pokke’s Helpers]]

##### **Eidolon 2**
	Reedside Promenade: With Ruan Mei on the field, all allies 
    increase their ATK by **40%** when dealing DMG to enemies with 
    Weakness Break.
This Eidolon provides a decent amount of damage amplification when the conditions are met. However these conditions cannot be consistently met in crit teams, and whilst they can be met easily in break teams: the buff is meaningless for normal break damage and can only be taken advantage of by units with ATK conversion built into their kit. With all of this in mind,it becomes obvious that  E2 is a poor stopping point. 

##### **Eidolon 4**
	Chatoyant Éclat: When an enemy target's Weakness is Broken, 
    Ruan Mei's Break Effect increases by 100% for 3 turn(s).
Like most E4’s, this doesn’t do much. Whilst it does provide a significant boost in Break effect, it provides little benefit to the team when running a well built Ruan Mei, as you will already be hitting the maximum amplification potential without this break effect buff. This means that if your Ruan Mei is properly built, the only benefit you reap from this eidolon is additional delay to enemies when triggering ‘Thanatoplum Rebloom’. 

##### **Eidolon 6**
	Sash Cascade: Extends the duration of the Ultimate's field by 
    1 turn(s). The Talent's Break DMG multiplier additionally 
    increases by 200%.
Whilst this does provide a significant increase in Ruan Meis uptime, and personal damage. It once again lacks a real purpose, as a properly built RM with a correctly tuned ultimate rotation will be able to hit 100% ultimate uptime with no issue, this means that the only real benefit is the 200% Break DMG multiplier. Which is hefty, but is not worth an E6.
