**Base Stats:** HP = 1281        DEF = 485        ATK = 640        SPD = 102**
## 1. Stat Goals
These are the stats you should aim to have outside of battle.

- **3100+ HP**     
- **4000+ ATK**     
- **1200+ DEF**
- **120 SPD** OR **116.67 SPD** (If you don't need it to proc sets)
- Using her signature light cone, aim for 1300+ DEF and 4500+ ATK.

## 2. Traces Priority
**Ultimate > Skill > Talent**
**All ascension ability are important and must be unlocked.**
- Stat bonus traces should be unlocked according to stat priority.

## 3. Light Cone Rankings 
1. **Flowing Nightglow:** [Robin's Signature 5★ Light Cone]
	1. `Base ATK: 635   Base HP: 953   Base DEF: 463`
	Robin's ERR is increased by 3% every time an ally attacks, up to 5 stacks and using Ultimate resets the stacks to increase the wearer's ATK by 48% and all allies' DMG (Bonus) by 24% for 1 turn. Has the highest amount of base ATK out of her options. 
- Compared to *Bronya's* Signature 5★ Light Cone, it has ~20% higher team damage amplification and ~25% higher Robin personal damage.

2. **But the Battle Isn't Over**: [Bronya's Signature 5★ Light Cone]
	`Base ATK: 529   Base HP: 1164   Base DEF: 463`
	Increases the wearer's ERR by 10% and the DMG (Bonus) of the next ally after the wearer's turn by 30%. Has high base stats and ERR, which make it better than Tomorrow's Journey Light Cone.

3. **Poised to Bloom**: [Gacha 4★ Light Cone]
	`Base ATK: 423   Base HP: 953   Base DEF: 397`
  ! Only use with 2+ allies with the same path in the team !
	Increases the wearer's ATK by 16% and increases Crit. DMG of allies with the same path by 16%. High amplification and decent base stats. Has slightly higher amplification at superimposition 5 than even signature light cone in team compositions that can use it.

4. **For Tomorrow's Journey**: [Free Time-Limited 4★ Light Cone]
	`Base ATK: 476   Base HP: 953   Base DEF: 331`
	Increases the wearer's ATK by 32% and their DMG dealt (DMG Bonus) by 30% after using their Ultimate, lasting for 1 turn. Has decent base stats for a 4★ Light Cone and a passive that increases Robin's ATK buff and personal damage.

5. **Carve the Moon, Weave the Clouds:** [Nameless Honor 4★ Light Cone]
	`Base ATK: 476   Base HP: 953   Base DEF: 331`
	At the start of the wearer's turn, provides **1** of 3 effects: Increases all allies' ERR by 12%, all allies' ATK by 20% or all allies' Crit. DMG by 24%. Rather RNG but is still an option if you don't have any of the others on the list.

## **4. Main Stats**
- **Body**: ATK
- **Feet**: ATK
- **Sphere**: ATK
- **Link Rope**: Energy Regeneration Rate (ERR)
- Depending on the team and your eidolon investment, you might be able to use a ATK rope instead of a ERR one.
NOTE: **If you get a Physical DMG Bonus main stat sphere with good substats, it's totally fine to use it. You may even find better results than with ATK.**

## 5. Subsidiary Stats Priority 
1. **Speed** Minimum necessary is 116.667, or 120 if you need to for planar ornament set effects.
2. **ATK%** Prioritise this until ~4000 ATK without Signature LC / ~4500 ATK with Sign LC.
3. **HP% & DEF%**
4. Flat ATK
**Note:**
- Robin can't be inflicted with crowd control debuffs during her ultimate, making effect resistance sub-stats nearly useless for her specifically.
- Robin's 'Additional Physical DMG' is **fixed** at 100% Crit. RATE and 150% Crit. DMG. This makes building those stats __useless__ on her as they don't increase the additional damage of her ultimate.
## 6. Relic Sets
**Set effects are not necessary**
Robin's best relic set is a combination of ATK buffing 2-piece sets. Sets usable on Robin:
- **2-piece The Wind-Soaring Valorous**
- **2-piece Prisoner in Deep Confinement**
- **2-piece Musketeer of Wild Wheat**
   ↑ Each of the 3 above provide a 12% ATK increase to Robin.

- **2-piece / 4-piece Champion of Streetwise Boxing** Increases Robin's personal damage and, at 4-Pc set effect, her ATK after using her basic attack or getting hit. Technically BiS for Robin's personal damage but is RNG.

- **2-piece Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters** Good for her personal damage but doesn't increase her attack buff, bringing less team damage increase.

## 7. Planar Sets 
Planar Ornament set effects are often quite good so we recommend going for them if you can. The difference between planar sets isn't too huge overall.
1. **Lushaka, the Sunken Seas** `Best-in-Slot` Increases the wearer's ERR by 5% and increases the ATK of the first character in the party line-up (besides the wearer) by 12%.

2. **Sprightly Vonwacq** Good set for general usage with its 5% ERR and Advance Forward at battle start. Other sets are better if you don't need the AF *or* ERR.

3. **Fleet of the Ageless** Highest team damage amplification for teams including more than 1 damage dealer, with 8% ATK buff to all allies and a nice 12% HP buff to Robin. Get to 120 SPD for the 8% ATK buff.

4. **Space Sealing Station** Increases Robin's attack buff the most, with a total 24% ATK increase, but provides no ERR. Fleet of the Ageless can amplify team damage more but this set is a generally solid option. Get to 120 SPD to obtain the full 24% ATK.

5. **Penacony, Land of the Dreams** Helps with Robin's energy problems with the 5% ERR it gives and increases all other allies' DMG (DMG Bonus) by 10% that are of the same element as the wearer. *Only use with a physical element damage dealer.*

6. **Firmament Frontline: Glamoth** Only increases Robin's ATK by 12%, having its full effect locked behind 135/160 SPD. The best at increasing Robin's personal damage, but generally the worst of her options overall.

- **Broken Keel** is also usable, but we don't recommend it outside of teams with Aventurine as getting 20 effect resistance from sub-stats is a bit of a waste compared to getting ATK, HP or DEF instead.

>[!tip] Lushaka or Vonwacq?
> Both have 5% ERR, so we're comparing 40% AF at battle start and 12% ATK buff for your damage dealer. A Robin with 120 speed will already be faster than a 160 SPD damage dealer even without Vonwacq, which makes Lushaka generally better than Vonwacq, though only by 12% ATK.



## 8. Energy & Rotations:
>[!info] Rotation Info: 
>Robin's rotation depends on her allies.** In most teams, she will have to take 2 turns after her ultimate ends before she can use her ultimate again, due to the lower frequency of ally attacks.
>- With a average 120 SPD Robin, you will need to wait another 83.333 Action Value before being able to use Robin's ultimate again, which is rather slow.


**However, there are ways to have Robin use her ultimate more often.**
To make Robin use her ultimate from one skill usage in most teams, the easiest way is to have a abundance path character like Gallagher use Quid Pro Quo light cone. Every time this abundance path character's turn comes up, they will be able to give Robin 16 Energy, a whole tenth of her energy cost. 
- The best abuser of this light cone is Gallagher with the 100% Action Forward after using his ultimate.
- Huohuo can help Robin even more with her ultimate that regenerates energy, but she will still have to use Quid Pro Quo for consistency as her own ultimate requires charging.

Teams that have high attack frequency (please refer to section 9 of the guide for examples of such teams) __**don't**__ require an abundance character with Quid Pro Quo to generate enough energy for Robin so she can use her Ultimate right after her previous one ends.

##  9. Teams and RGM Relevancy:
**RGM = Rotating Game Mode (MoC, PF and AS)**
`Robin is one of the most universal supports in the game`, making her relevant in all content.

**Robin works very well in nearly all team compositions.**
- She loses some effectiveness in teams that don't fully utilise her buffs and team compositions with damage dealers whose damage doesn't scale off of ATK.
- For Boothill, she can still be fine with her ultimate's damage and action forward, allowing Boothill to get 2 extra turns in a cycle together with Bronya.
- Her ATK Buff does not increase Firefly's break effect, due to it being a Flat increase in ATK based on Robin's ATK, making her buffs useless for Firefly.
>[!info] To Note:
>**However, she especially excels in teams containing FuA characters**, with their __high attack frequency__. Her buffs are slightly catered to them and they allow her to make full use of her kit by providing her energy and proc-ing her Ultimate's additional damage often.

**Examples of such teams:**
- Feixiao | Topaz | Robin | Aventurine 
- Jade | March 7th | Robin | Aven
- Dr. Ratio | Moze | Robin | Aven
- Blade | Jade | Robin | Aven
- Herta | Himeko | Robin | Huohuo

- Aventurine can be replaced by Lingsha or any character that is able to use Quid Pro Quo.
- Aventurine and Lingsha aren't necessary, but they are the only characters that can sustain the team while attacking frequently enough to not *need* to use Quid Pro Quo.

Some examples of damage dealers Robin works well with and their team, other than the ones mentioned before:
- Yunli Eg: Yunli | Tingyun | Robin | Huohuo
- Jingliu Eg: Jingliu | Bronya | Robin | Gallagher
- Jade: Eg: Jade | Bronya | Robin | Gallagher
	- ↑ Jade Hypercarry
- Kafka: Eg: Kafka | Black Swan | Robin | Huohuo
- DHIL: eg: DHIL | Robin | Ruan Mei / Sparkle | Gallagher

**If you don't want to use a sustain character and are wondering what you could use, you should ask in <#1108990029365264444>.** 

## 10. Important Things to Note:
*These are things we didn't think fit into other sections and/or don't a dedicated section of their own.*

- If you have buffs that only last for 1 Turn then you can use Robin's ultimate again before she takes turn (after Concerto ends) to retain the buff, granted you have the energy to do so.

- A unit needs 157.500 SPD to have 3 Turns total within Robin Ultimate with 1 Eagle proc, or 158.400 with one S5 DDD proc.

# **Notable Eidolons:**
1. **Eidolon 1, Land of Smiles** During Robin's ultimate, all allies' all-type resistance penetration increases by 24%.
  ↑ This is an insane buff for a first eidolon, even greater than that of Ruan Mei, being a 24% to 40% increase in damage by itself (depending on enemy resistance). The caveat is that it's only active during her ultimate.
2. **Eidolon 6, Moonless Midnight** The first 8 instances of Additional Damage from her ultimate will now deal 450% more Crit. DMG. 
  ↑ This makes her deal an *insane* amount of damage for a support. The damage you can expect varies based on the situation so I suggest you look deeper into it yourself if you're interested.
3. **Eidolon 2, Afternoon Tea For Two** The talent's energy generation increases from 2 to 3 for every ally attack and increases all allies' SPD by 16% during the Ultimate's duration.
   ↑ This eidolon makes it very easy to have a permanent up-time on her ultimate in most if not all teams, even allowing her to use a ATK% Rope in FuA teams. Additionally, the 16% SPD buff can be useful in some situations.

## 11. Build Examples
We will be giving you 3 examples of a good build.
1. Using Robin's Signature 5★ Light Cone
2. Using Bronya's Signature 5★ Light Cone
3. Using For Tomorrow's Journey

- We'll also show an example of a build with almost 0 ATK sub-stats achieving 4000 ATK on Robin with her signature, simply having the right main stats and good 2-Pc set effects.
- Notice how the relics don't change depending on the light cone.
