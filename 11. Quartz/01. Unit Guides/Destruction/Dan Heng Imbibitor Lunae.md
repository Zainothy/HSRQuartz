## 1. Base Stats

- **HP:** 1241.9  
- **ATK:** 698.54  
- **DEF:** 363.82  
- **SPD:** 102  

- **Base ATK with Signature:** 1333 ATK  
- **Base CR:** 17% (35 with Signature)  

## 2. Traces Priority

- **Order:** Basic → Skill = Talent → Ult  
- **Max All**

## 3. Light Cones

- Brighter than the Sun  
- On the Fall of an Aeon  
- The Moles Welcome You  

## 4. Main Stats

- **Body:** CRITDMG / CRITRATE  
- **Feet (Boots):** ATK  
- **Orb:** IMG / ATK  
- **Rope:** ATK  

- **ATK Orb:** Better with Ruan Mei  
- **IMG Orb:** Can still outperform ATK Orbs on Ruan Mei teams if DHIL can reach an adequate amount of ATK (3400+) on IMG Orb  

## 5. Subsidiary Stats Priority

- **Order:** CRITRATE → CRITDMG → ATK  
- SPD is team dependent, refer to the SPD section.  

- Missing a crit in the 7 hits of Fulgurant Leap is very likely and results in a significant damage loss. DHIL has a ramping DMG% and CDMG% buff on his attack, so prioritize having an adequate amount of CRITRATE.

## 6. Endgame Stats

- **3200 ATK**  
- **90-100 CRITRATE**  
- **150 CRITDMG**  
- (3700+ on ATK Orb)  

*Disclaimer: These are not Syz-approved stats.*

## 7. SPD

- On teams with Sparkle, DHIL does not require any speed at all.  
- On Sparkleless teams, aim for 134 effective speed on IL while using an ATK boot.  

### Effective 134 SPD Requirements:

- 124 SPD with Ruan Mei  
- 118 SPD with Tingyun on S5 DDD  
- 108 SPD with Ruan Mei and Tingyun on S5 DDD  
- 112 SPD with Ruan Mei and E1 Huohuo  

If you cannot reach effective 134 SPD with ATK boots, it is acceptable to run SPD boots on a Robin team. While this is less optimal, it is still usable. For non-Robin teams, it’s generally recommended not to play them.

## 8. Relic Sets

His sets are team-dependent. You can mix and match 2+2 combinations.

- **2p ATK + 2p IMG** (General BiS)  
- **2p ATK + 2p ATK** (Generally good)  
- **2p Debuff + 2p IMG** (BiS with Robin + RM)  
- **2p ATK + 2p Debuff** (with RM)  
- **2p Scholar (8 Crit Rate) + 2p ATK/IMG/Debuff**  
- **4p Musketeer of the Wild Wheat**  

Choose based on supports and domain efficiency. The IMG domain is very inefficient, and sets don’t matter as much on IL. This is why Wheat, despite being worse than the 2P + 2P options, remains viable, as it helps ease the speed sub-requirements.

### Planar Sets

- **2p Rutilant Arena**  
- **2p Firnament Frontline: Glamoth**  
- **2p Space Sealing Station**  

It's almost always a Rutilant **angle**.
