| Acheron   | DPS which gains ult stacks when enemies get debuffed.                                    | Really wants signature Light Cone.  <br>  <br>100% Crit. RATE after set bonuses like 4pc Pioneer and 2pc Izumo.  <br>150%+ Crit. DMG  <br>ATK Boots | Acheron damage mainly comes from her ultimate.  <br>  <br>Aventurine has the ability to stack it up quickly using his signature Light Cone or Trend of The Universal Market (unless you’re using Jiaoqiu).  <br>  <br>He provides more stacks for Acheron than other sustainers while doing decent damage and increasing Acheron DMG slightly with ult.                                                                            |
| Feixiao   | DPS that gains ult stacks every time an ally attacks. Follow-up Attacks                  | No eidolon/signature investment needed, although welcome.  <br>  <br>95%+ Crit. RATE  <br>140%+ Crit. DMG  <br>SPD Boots                            | Feixiao wants allies to initiate as many attacks as possible.  <br>  <br>The only sustainer that even comes close at stack generation is Gallagher but Aventurine still beats him by a decent amount at that, while additionally dealing decent damage himself.  <br>  <br>Aventurine also fits well into the best Feixiao team compositions as he can help units like Topaz and Robin deal more damage through his usage of FuAs. |
| Dr. Ratio | DPS that gains stacks for his Talent. through the number of debuffs placed on the enemy. | 85% Crit. RATE  <br>150%+ Crit. DMG  <br>ATK Boots with Tingyun  <br>SPD Boots with Topaz and Robin.                                                | Dr ratio requires 3 debuffs to consistently initiate a Follow-up Attack every time you use his skill. Aventurine can provide one with his ultimate (and another one with his FuA using his signature) whilst dealing damage, unlike Gallagher.  <br>  <br>Aventurine also fits well in a full follow up attack Ratio team, with Topaz and Robin.                                                                                   |
| Yanqing   | Loses massive buffs if hit. Requires a shielder to not lose said buffs.                  | 40-50% Crit. RATE  <br>200% Crit. DMG  <br>ATK Boots                                                                                                | If Yanqing is hit he loses massive self applied buffs and a chance to initiate Follow-up Attacks.  <br>For that, Aventurine is the best as his immense shields easily prevent Yanqing from losing those buffs.  <br>  <br>Aven provides nice buffs and a secondary source of damage.                                                                                                                                               |

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Topaz and Numby|Applies Follow-up Attack vulnerability to a target.|90%+ Crit. RATE  <br>140%+ Crit. DMG  <br>SPD Boots|Topaz fits with many of the teammates that Aventurine synergies with such as Robin, Feixaio and Dr. Ratio.  <br>  <br>Aventurine’s Follow-up Attacks also help Numby get more actions.|
|Moze|Applies Follow-up Attack vulnerability to a target, although less than Topaz.  <br>  <br>Increases Crit. DMG taken by the ‘Prey’ enemy with his E2.|Needs Eidolon 2 for the 40% Crit DMG received debuff.  <br>  <br>4Pc Pioneer Diver  <br>96% Crit. RATE  <br>140%+ Crit. DMG|Moze fits with many teammates that Aventurine synergizes with, much like Topaz.  <br>  <br>Aventurine’s Follow-up Attacks help Moze unleash his Follow-up Attacks quicker.|

## 3. Example Team Compositions  
**BiS:**
### FART

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Feixiao|Topaz|Robin|Aventurine|

>[!tip] Team Setup & Explanation:
>Aventurine provides Feixiao with a ton of stacks here, and together with Topaz and Feixiao even allowing Robin to have great up-time on her Ultimate just by the sheer amount of attacks the team can dish out for Robin to get energy from and also have her deal additional damage.  
> Make sure to use Aventurine’s skill when you see that your shields are too low.  
>
>By having Topaz and Feixiao use speed boots, you should be able to get your Robin ultimate up and ready to use by the time your Feixiao’s turn is over, which is when will be the best time to you use it to get the most out of it.  
>
>This is also where SPD Boots for Aventurine comes into play, as with SPD boots here he would only get one turn in first wave and two turns in second wave, as with SPD boots where you can get 3 per wave. In this case, you wait to use Robin’s ultimate at the start of battle until after Aventurine’s turn.  
>
> For after the battle’s starts, you will pretty much just want to use Robin’s ultimate whenever it’s ready or if you see that some allies are about to act shortly after (~40AV or less) the time when you got enough energy for Robin to ult then just wait until those teammates have had their turn before you use Robin’s ultimate.  
> You will want Topaz to be faster than Feixiao, so that Topaz is able to target an enemy with the Proof of Debt and increase Feixiao’s damage.  
 **For example on speed tuning: 138SPD Topaz, 137SPD Feixiao, 134 SPD Aventurine, 120 SPD Robin**  

### RRAT

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Dr. Ratio|Moze|Robin|Aventurine|

>[!tip] Team Setup & Explanation: 
>Moze and Aventurine provide enough debuffs for Dr. Ratio to always have him use his Follow-up Attack after he uses his skill. The team has synergy much like the previous team, though Robin might not get enough energy compared to the previous team.  
>
>Plays pretty much the same as the previous team, just in that you might want to time your Robin’s ultimate so that she brings up Moze’s action right after he exits the ‘Departed’ state.   
>
>Use Moze’s skill on the more tanky enemies and prioritize attacking that enemy instead of other enemies.  
  
### Yanqing Hypercarry Team:

|         |       |         |            |
| ------- | ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| Yanqing | Robin | Tingyun | Aventurine |

>[!tip] Team Setup & Explanation:
>Aventurine will be shielding Yanqing, thus preventing him from losing his talent’s ‘Soulsteel Sync’.  
For Yanqing’s ultimate, even though you would get enough energy for it at the start of battle if you were to use Tingyun’s Ultimate on him, you will want to just use Tingyun’s ultimate on Robin instead, so that you can get her ultimate ready by the time Yanqing’s turn ends.  
>
Ideally, you will want Tingyun to use Dance! Dance! Dance! Light Cone in this team, so that Yanqing can get a second turn before the first cycle ends, using ATK boots. If you don’t have a DDD or don’t want to use it then you can just use SPD boots on Yanqing and a S5 Memories of the Past or S5 Meshing Cogs.  
>
For Tingyun, you’re going to just want to use your skill whenever its duration has expired or is close to expiring.  
Tingyun with Robin on the team has the ability to use HP/DEF Main stat body and sphere pieces instead of ATK ones, because she can get enough ATK for her buff thanks to Robin.  
>
She also has this ability because her skill does something called “Snapshotting”. Her skill snapshotting in this case means that the ability uses the stats and buffs applied at the time of the skill activation, so even if Robin’s buff expires Tingyun’s skill will still buff for the same amount.  
>
If you use this, you will mostly want to only use your skill during Robin’s ultimate.  
>
In the case that you find yourself with a charged Tingyun ultimate, but with Robin and Yanqing already at high energy or charged ultimates so that they would be wasting Tingyun ult’s energy generation, then it’s advisable to use Tingyun’s ultimate on herself (unless Yanqing’s turn comes shortly after or buffs are already applied and have a charged Yanqing ult so that you can just use it)  
  
### **E0S1 Acheron team:**

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Acheron|Jiaoqiu|Pela|Aventurine|

>[!warning] Sig: 
>In this team, Aventurine will want his signature light cone to be able to generate ultimate stacks for Acheron. If he doesn’t have it then he will simply just be a sustain, not even being able to use Trend of the Universal Market due to Jiaoqiu.  
Jiaoqiu disabling Trend of the Universal Market happens because of Acheron’s cap of 1 stack gain per action. Jiaoqiu already reapplies his debuff at the start of the enemy’s turn, so even if they attack Aventurine to have them get burned, it wouldn’t generate another stack as that second debuff was still applied in that same action.  
  
>[!info] Team Setup & Explanation:
>Use Acheron’s ultimate when all Jiaoqiu stacks are up and after Pela’s ultimate has been used on the enemies, that way it will deal the most damage.  
>
If enemies are low enough in the first wave for you to kill them with a skill  
In situations where you are just a little bit off of getting Pela’s ultimate, it’s going to depend on the enemy’s remaining HP and Pela’s AV left until her turn, whether you use Acheron’s ultimate or wait. If the answer to the first condition is “low” then you can use Acheron’s ultimate without waiting, or if the answer to the second condition is also “low” and Pela’s turn doesn’t leak over into the next cycle then you can wait for that as well, in the case that enemies are not low enough to kill without Pela ult.  
>
If the answer to the first condition is “high” then you will likely want to wait until Pela’s turn.  
  
**Make sure to use Aventurine’s skill if you see that your shields are dangerously low.**  
  
## 4. How to Play:
Aventurine is a very simple and easy unit to play. You use skill when your shields are low or if a big attack is coming. Generally use the Ultimate for the tankier enemies to make better use of the debuff that he inflicts with it and because it deals a lot of damage, especially on a damage dealer build.    
  
## 5. Trace Levelling Priority:
Skill > Talent > Ultimate  
Do not worry too much about leveling up the basic attack as it only makes a minor difference.  
All Ascension Ability traces are worth unlocking.  
## 6. Light Cone Requirements  
  
### **Damage Dealer Build LCs**

|                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inherent Unjust Death         | Best in slot Light Cone for every situation, significantly increases his viability as a sub dps, while providing him the most defence and an additional debuff for the team.                                                     |
| Moment of Victory             | Second best in slot Light Cone for both sustaining and sub dps purposes,the raw stats provide more damage than the 4 star alternatives and it has the benefit of drawing agro for follow ups.                                    |
| Texture of Memories           | Textures lands in the middle, for both damage and defence, with its only benefit being some extra effect res for Aventurine.                                                                                                     |
| Trend of the Universal Market | There is no reason to run Trend unless you are running Aventurine with Acheron and lack his signature or need another debuff for Ratio.                                                                                          |
| Landau’s Choice               | A worse version of Textures of Memories in terms of stats, while replacing the effect res for some agro.                                                                                                                         |
| Destiny's Threads Forewoven   | In theory it should be one of the better options for sub dps Aventurine however its low base defence and lack of defence % leaves it falling short of that.                                                                      |
| Concert for Two               | This is the best 4 star option for sub dps Aventurine, while still providing some of the highest defence substats out of the 4 stars.                                                                                            |
| This is Me!                   | Provides slightly less damage then Concert for Two however it gives slightly more defence.                                                                                                                                       |
| Day One of My New Life        | Is able to provide the team with more damage than most other options and if his build is lacking it will provide more overall damage than Moment of Victory and Concert for Two, with the caveat of less comfortable sustaining. |
| She Already Shut Her Eyes     | Fu Xuan’s signature provides the same defence as Textures, while healing the team at the start of each wave and giving them a slight damage boost.                                                                               |
| Everything else               | The remaining 4 star and 3 star Light Cones are worse off then their other free alternatives so there is no need to use them                                                                                                     |

## 7. Build Requirements  
### **Damage Dealer:** 
>[!info] DPS Capability:
> Aventurine is rather easy to build as a damage dealer, as his talent provides him with 48% Crit. RATE, as well as being able to use 4Pc Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters which is an additional 8% Crit. RATE.  
If you’re using 4pc Pioneer, you’re going to want 48% Crit. RATE on the stat screen out-side of battle. If you’re not using 4pc Pioneer, you’re going to want as close to 52% Crit. RATE as you can.  
For Crit. DMG, aim for 170%+. Or for 200%+ for a great build.  
  
**Main Stats**  
Body - Crit. DMG  
Boots - DEF

Sphere - Imaginary DMG > DEF  
Link Rope - DEF  
  
**Sub-stat Priority**  
1. Crit. RATE until ~48%.  
2. Crit. DMG as much of it as you can.  
3. DEF% less than Crit. DMG but still nice to get.  
4. SPD (optional)  
  
**Speed Boots?**  
We only recommend using SPD boots for a Damage Dealer Aventurine build when you’re using him in a Follow-up Attack team, to justify the defense and thus the damage and shielding loss by getting more Blind Bet stacks through resetting his  
  
#### **Relic Sets**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Knights of Purity Palace or Guard of Wuthering Snow|Neither 4pc provides the damage needed for sub dps Aventurine.Being coupled with other sets that most people no longer use.|
|Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters|The best option for Aventurine’s damage with his signature, he is able to consistently provide debuffs to keep the full 4pc effect active|
|2pc The Ashblazing Grand Duke + 2pc Knights of Purity Palace/Guard of Wuthering Snow|A middle ground set, losing dps potential for more comfortable sustaining|
|Wastelander of Bandutary Desert|Not recommended, 4pc Pioneer is better while being more efficient to farm.|
|2pc The Ashblazing Grand Duke + 2pc Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters/Wastelander of Bandutary Desert|2pc2pc damage is the second best option for Aventurine, being able to outdo Pioneer if there is a lack of debuffs on the team.|

  
  
  
  
#### **Planar Ornament Sets**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Inert Salsotto|While it can provide more damage then Duran in a situation with slow enemies and lack of team follow ups, the efficiency of the domain is poor as the only other user of Belobog is Aventurine and most dps unit do not use Salsotto.|
|Duran Dynasty of Runny Wolves|The best overall set for Aventurines damage, the frequency of follow ups from himself and his usual teams are able to stack its effect quickly.|
|Broken Keel|Keel sacrifices Aventurines personal damage to help the team, can be farmed for other supports as its cd bonus will always be active provided your shields are up.|
|Belobog of the Architects|Not recommended for sub dps- lack of damage|
|Lushaka, the Sunken Seas|Not recommended for sub dps- lack of damage|


  
  
### **Pure Sustain Aventurine**  
>[!info] Sustain Capability:
>Aventurine on a pure sustain build only cares about 3 things: 1. as much defence as possible, 2. To hit a high SPD break point and 3. to hit 50% Effect Resistance. This is essentially to provide the tankiest shields to his teammates, speed so that he can refresh his shields more often if needed and 50% Effect RES so that he never gets CC’d. For such a build gaining 50% extra effect resistance to cap out at 100%is ideal but gaining 50% from substats is difficult so getting as much as possible is good.  
  
**Main Stats**  
Chest - DEF  
Boots - DEF or SPD  
Sphere - DEF  
Link Rope - DEF  
  
**Sub-stat Priority**  
1. DEF%  
2. SPD  
  
#### **Relic Sets**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Knights of Purity Palace|While technically the strongest set in terms of shielding, the domain itself is very inefficient, there are no characters who use the lightning set|
|Guard of Wuthering Snow|A worse version of Knight, however 4pc quantum is usable on certain dps units like seele and jade.|
|2pc SPD (Sacerdos’ &  Hackerspace)|If the substats are up to part this can help making sure Aventurine defence is high enough while staying fast.|
|2pc speed/defence + 2pc defence/speed/rainbow|The most efficient way to build sustain aventurine is to either mix 2pc2pc or run rainbow with the best substats, as no 4pc set bonus is particularly needed.|

  
#### **Planar Ornament Sets**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Broken Keel|The best general set for pure sustaining, an always active 10% cd buff with extra effect res, can be farmed for other supports as well.|
|Lushaka, the Sunken Seas|If the dps is lacking in atk buffs then this can be a good alternative for keel, only farm it if building BananAmusement for Jing Yuan currently.|
|Belobog of the Architects|Provides the strongest shields, however it is extremely inefficient to farm, and the increase in shield strength is not big enough to justify it.|

## 8. Eidolon Break Down

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Eidolon 1|Increased the crit damage of all allies by 20% when shields are active, basically permanent up-time as you always should be shielded. After ult gives a shield equal in strength to the skill. Functionally allows Aven to never need to skill.|
|Eidolon 2|When basic provides 12% res shred for 3 turns, providing  a strong debuff makes Aventurine’s basic targeting more important. Basically hit the elites.|
|Eidolon 3|Ultimate trace +2 levels  <br>Basic trace +1 level  <br>Minor damage increase|
|Eidolon 4|When the follow up attack fires, increase defence by 40% for 2 turns.and increases follow up attack hits by 3, almost always active. Doesn’t do much unless it's coupled with E6.|
|Eidolon 5|Skill trace +2 levels  <br>Talent trace +2 levels  <br>Minor damage increase|
|Eidolon 6|Every teammate that has a shield increases damage dealt by 50% per teammate max 150%. Basically this is permanent 150% damage dealt.  <br>Very strong buff that makes aven into a main dps and highest dps sustainer.|
## 9. RGM Relevancy  
> [!warning] Future Proof?
> Aventurine in apocalyptic shadow depends on if the enemy is imaginary weak. If the enemy isn't then it means nothing as apocalyptic shadow is break based. The enemy amount of attacks don't really affect Aven too much since as Aven is the only imaginary preservation. Ideally though the enemy would attack a lot to make many aventurine follow up attacks.
  
## 10. Extra Things to Note  
Enemy Match-ups Aventurine deals damage based on gaining stacks when his shields get hit and to abuse this to the maximum extent enemies that hit him alot. Enemies such as Hoolay do very well for aventurine and ideally also imaginary weak will provide aventurine the best chance at dealing damage. Aventurines worst matchup will be enemies that don't hit him at all such as enemies that do dot damage. This doesn't mean that aventurine wont sustain or have all the other benefits that he provides its that his sub dps strength will be greatly diminished.
