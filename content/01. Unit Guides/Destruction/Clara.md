## 1. Character Overview
> [!context] Profile
> Clara is a Physical element Damage Dealer, utilizing Follow-up Attacks initiated as Counters to enemies attacking her or, with her ultimate active, her allies as her main source of damage. She is a good starter unit that struggles compared to some of the more powerful Damage Dealers late game, especially Yunli who is a direct upgrade. 
## 2. Teammates

### **Sustain Slot Characters:**  

Sustainers for Clara should firstly make sure Clara doesn't die especially as she is targeted more often than other units thanks to her ultimate. With Tingyun being the only energy-generating support we have atm but having low damage amplification compared to 5 Star options and Clara requiring a energy-generating teammate, it’s extremely welcome if a sustain could fill that slot instead of relegating it to a support’s. Huohuo can fulfil that role and Gallagher too, to an extent.

### **Support Slot Characters:**  
Support teammates for Clara mainly focus on increasing damage and providing energy for higher Clara ultimate up-time.

### Sub DPS Characters:  
Sub dps characters are only really valuable in teams with Robin, maybe excluding Topas and are there to secondarily abuse Robin’s additional damage alongside Clara.

## 4. How to Play the Unit

In general, you will want to use your Ultimate so that no energy is wasted. For example with Tingyun, if Clara is only a little bit of energy off of using her Ultimate and you have Tingyun’s ultimate ready to use too, then you will want to hold off on using Tingyun’s ultimate until after you use Clara’s ultimate.  
  
Always try to use Clara’s skill if possible, to gain as much energy and deal as much damage as possible, but it's fine to basic if it’s to reapply a buff or to make sure you can live by reserving a skill point for your sustain character.  
 

## 5. Trace Levelling Priority  
    Talent = Ultimate > Skill  
    Don’t level up the basic attack unless you’re using Brighter Than the Sun.  
    All Ascension Ability traces are worth unlocking. Stat Bonus traces of ATK% and Physical DMG% types, though ones of HP% ones are fine to unlock if it means unlocking ones of ATK% or Physical DMG types.  
    
## 6. Light Cones

|                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dance at Sunset          | Best In Slot Light Cone by far. Increase in Aggro allows Clara to be a lot more consistent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| The Unreachable Side     | Always better than Clara’s signature light cone. Is a decent Light Cone for most Destruction path characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Something Irreplaceable  | Worth Light Cone to buy from the shop if either Aeon is used on another character or don’t have Aeon at all.  <br>  <br>It is not worth the cost of 30 pulls.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Brighter Than the Sun    | Needs Clara to basic attack 2 times for her first two turns. Then rotate between skill and basic to maintain 2 stacks.  <br>  <br>Provides a monstrous amount of ATK once fully stacked.  <br>  <br>Not worth buying from Starlight Exchange instead of 30 pulls.                                                                               |
| On the Fall of An Aeon   | Generally good Light Cone and obtainable together with its superimpositions for free through Herta’s Shop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Nowhere to Run           | Very similar to Aeon damage at S5, with Aeon having a  higher ATK buff at max stacks but lower ATK buff at lower stack amounts.  <br>  <br>Superimposition 1 is worse than the 2 options below: Ninja Record: Sound Hunt and A Secret Vow.    <br>  <br>Obtained through buying the Nameless Glory (Battle Pass) and getting to level 30 on it. |
| Ninja Record: Sound Hunt | About the same as Nowhere to Run at S2, but worse onwards.  <br>  <br>Limited-Time Event Light Cone. Still                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| A Secret Vow             | Better than Ninja Record: Sound Hunt at S4+. Inconsistent passive.  <br>  <br>Obtained through Gacha.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Woof! Walk Time!         | Obtained through the MoC shop, together with its superimpositions.  <br>  <br>Only use if you have literally nothing else. Pls upgrade                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

  

## 7. Relics Requirements  
    Build Requirements  
    100% Crit. RATE is very much needed as any non-crit hit reduces your damage a lot.  
    Just try to get as much Crit. DMG as you can, while still being as close as you can to 100% Crit. RATE.  
    Speed for Clara is not needed at all as most of her damage happens outside of her turn.  
      
      
    Main Stats  
    Body - Crit. RATE (Crit DMG only if you can still reach 100% CR with it)  
    Boots - ATK

Sphere - Physical DMG > ATK (Only use ATK Sphere if you have a lot better sub-stats on it)  
Link Rope - ATK  
  
ATK rope vs ERR Rope  
ATK main stat will just always be better out-side of Pure Fiction. Pure Fiction is where ERR Rope is generally better than ATK Rope but even this depends on the team and Memory Turbulence.  
  
### Sub-Stats  
1. Crit. RATE until you have 100% in-battle.  
2. Crit. DMG as much of it as you can.  
3. ATK% generally worse than Crit. DMG but still decent.  
  
### Relic Sets

|   |   |
|---|---|
|2pc Ashblazing Grand Duke<br><br>2pc Scholar lost in Erudition|The best combination of damage buffing and Crit. RATE stabilization. Highly recommended.|
|2pc Ashblazing Grand Duke<br><br>2pc ATK% Set|Next best set combination for damage, requires building more Crit. RATE than previous.|
|2pc Ashblazing Grand Duke<br><br>2pc Champion of Streetwise Boxing|Another solid combination of damage increasing 2pc sets requiring the same Crit. RATE compensation.|
|2pc Champion of Streetwise Boxing<br><br>2pc ATK% Set|Slightly worse than having a 2pc Ashblazing but worth using if you already have good pieces of it.|
|4pc Longevous Disciple|Gives a lot of Crit. RATE making her easier to build however provides no damage increasing bonuses. Use if you already have pieces lying around.|

           Planar Ornaments

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Duran, Dynasty of Running Wolves|Better over longer combat durations.  <br>  <br>Harder to build enough Crit. RATE.  <br>  <br>Will be better if running with Aventurine.  <br>  <br>Can be more efficient for your account depending on your units.|
|Inert Salsotto|Better over shorter combat durations and for higher damage for the first wave if you need it.  <br>  <br>Increases Crit. RATE, making the character easier to build.  <br>  <br>Generally better set than duran for most people|

  

## 8. Eidolon and Investment Run-Down

Clara’s Eidolon Investment:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Eidolon 1|When using skill, Marks won't be lost.|About a 10% DMG Increase, more of an increase when enemies attack you but not often.|
|Eidolon 2|30% ATK Buff after using Ultimate.|Very nice and simple buff.  <br>About 7% increase in damage compared to previous.  <br>Around 20% compared to E0.|
|Eidolon 3|Skill Trace LVL +2  <br>  <br>Basic Trace LVL +1|Around a 2% increase in DMG compared to previous.|
|Eidolon 4|After Clara is hit, she gains  30% damage reduction until her next turn.|0% Increase in DMG.  <br>Reduces Clara’s damage taken with Ultimate active by only an additional 15%.  <br>  <br>Doesn't really matter that much at all.|
|Eidolon 5|Tallent Trace LVL +2  <br>  <br>Ultimate Trace LVL +2|Around a 10% DMG Increase compared to Eidolon 3.|
|Eidolon 6|+1 Enhanced Counters during Ultimate  <br>  <br>50% chance to counter when allies other than Clara get hit.|More forgiving for when you don’t use Dance at Sunset LC or taunt increasers such as Lynx.  <br>  <br>Around an 18% Increase in DMG compared to E5. Increases even more the more of those 50/50 chances you win.  <br>~52% Increase compared to E0.|

Clara’s eidolons aren’t too good and you can’t get them reliably as there aren’t any Clara banners. For these reasons, if you are looking to invest further into Clara and her team, it’s best to look for other ways of doing so.  
  
**In order of damage increase to the team’s damage, we present you a list of the best investment route to take for Clara’s team:**  
![[Investment Chart.png|Investment Chart.png]]
1. Robin If you don’t already have her, make sure to get her as she is the best support for Clara. 
2. Dance at Sunset, Yunli’s signature light cone. It is a great damage increase to Clara and greatly increases her consistency in gameplay. By itself, it’s about a 30% increase to damage, which can be higher the more you get out of its aggro value increase buff.  
3. Robin’s Eidolon 1, increasing the entire team’s damage by 24% to 42% (depending on the enemy’s existing elemental RES to the element), granted her ultimate is always active.  
4. Huohuo She can act as the sole battery for Clara and Robin, generating energy for both with her ultimate and using Quid Pro Quo for even more energy. She also increases the team’s damage by increasing Clara’s ATK as well as Robin’s, which also increases the ATK buff given during her ultimate. She doesn’t increase the team’s damage as much but is necessary before being able to replace Tingyun.  
5. Sparkle With Huohuo on the team, Tingyun can be rather easily replaced as her main role in the team was that of a battery. Sparkle herself is a great upgrade from Tingyun, advancing forward Sparkle and giving her larger buffs, as well as having some of her buffs go to Robin, additionally increasing her damage. About a 23% team DMG Increase  
6. Sparkle’s Eidolon 2 Is about a 28% Increase in team DMG.  
7. Flowing Nightglow, Robin’s Signature Light Cone. ~8% team DMG Increase.  
8. Earthly Escapade, Sparkle’s Signature Light Cone. ~5% increase to Clara’s DMG.  

## 9. RGM Relevancy

Clara can perform in all 3 of the late-game rotating game modes RGMs (Those being Memory of Chaos, Pure Fiction and Apocalyptic Shadow.), granted the match-up favours her. More Details about Clara’s match-ups in section 11.  
  
Pure Fiction

Clara isn't the best at Pure Fiction but she is far from unusable. Her best team combines her with Jade (no E1 needed). Jade carries Clara for a free 40K points clear but Jade is more so being held back by Clara making this a Jade team. Other sub Damage Dealers like Herta and Himeko are in a similar position to jade. The single target Sub DPS-es are significantly less helpful in Pure Fiction where there are multiple targets to kill.  
If Clara can't run with Jade, Himeko or Herta then a more standard hypercarry comp is better.  
  
Ruan mei for hyper carry Clara is only worth it if Clara can kill before the enemy recovers from being weakness broken as it takes too long having to wait for the enemy to recover from the weakness break, on top of Ruan Mei’s delay, before they’re able to hit Clara and get killed by her Follow-up Attack.  
  
Dance at Sunset, Yunli’s signature light cone, has even higher value here, since counters are significant waveclear even for the non-enhanced ones. Taunt definitely helps for consistency as well here.  
Brighter Than The Sun is significantly worse as the energy from basic is never more worth than using your basic attack.  
Under the Blue Sky is a very good light cone in Pure Fiction as it gives a pretty consistent 24% Crit. RATE buff at S5 which makes it a very powerful Light Cone.

  
Yukong is also bad for Clara in Pure Fiction as making her speed tuning throughout a long battle is essentially an impossible task.

Debuffers are generally bad in pure fiction as their debuffs don’t last through waves. making them essentially useless for Clara and for Pure Fiction in general. Jiaoqiu’s ultimate can last through waves but if you’re clearing fast then not even it is permanently active but if needed Jiaoqiu is the best choice.  

Duran for Clara is better for pure fiction if 100% Crit. RATE is achieved since it easily reaches max stacks.  
Izumo can be great if you decide to use Clara as a sub-dps for another Destruction path character like Yunli, Blade or E2 DHIL  
  
Memory of Chaos and Apocalyptic Shadow.  

10. Extra Things to Note

Combat Tips  
  
Enemy Match-Ups  
In general, she wants enemies to attack her often, so that she can initiate her Counter Follow-up Attacks. Without enemies attacking her, she can’t deal a huge majority of her damage.  
This means that in cases like the Ebon Deer who doesn’t attack often, she won’t be able to dish out much damage.  
  
There are cases where Clara will get advanced forward or just act too fast, such that her ultimate’s stacks aren’t used fast enough and are wasted, such as when enemies simply don’t attack you often enough. In cases like these, there sadly isn’t much you could do besides bearing through it with Clara’s skill or just not using her.  
  
As much as clara on paper dislikes having physical weakness as it means that she can break the enemy resulting in less damage as the enemy doesn't counter her it is better to run her against phis weak as the buff from running on element is too big to ignore or complain about.
