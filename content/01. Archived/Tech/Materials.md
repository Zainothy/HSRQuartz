# Smart, Modern and Composite Materials: 

## Smart Materials: 
>[!info] Definition
>Smart materials are materials that have properties that can be changed from environmental factors such as heat. An example of a smart material is a shape memory alloy, an alloy that can return to its original shape, even after being bent or distorted, when exposed to heat. 
##### Examples of Smart Materials and their uses:

**SMA (Shape Memory Alloys)** can return to their original shape when heated, they cane be used on car frames that can be restored when dented, or spectacle frames when squashed. 

**Nickel Titanium (nitinol)** is a type of SMA, it can contract when heated, unlike how most metals expand when heated, because of this it is being used in braces. When braces are made from nitinol, they heat up in the mouth and “pull” on the teeth, this causes them to move with the nitinol 

Another example is **Thermochromic Pigments**, these pigments can change colour when exposed to thermal stimuli, these pigments can be mixed with polymers or paint to give materials the ability to change colour. An example of this is stickers that indicate the temperature of a sick person.

There are more smart materials such as : **Quantum Tunnelling Composite, Self Healing materials, Ferrofluids and Photochromic Pigments**


### Modern Materials: 

> [!info] Definition 
> Modern materials that have been developed to have enhanced properties, an example is titanium; it has a high strength to weight ratio and does not corrode easily

##### Examples of Modern Materials and their uses: 

**Concrete, aluminium and steel** are all common modern materials that have transformed the way we engineer products and buildings. 

A newer composite material is **Graphene**, it is comprised of a single layer of carbon, in theory: it is 100x stronger than steel. However, we are yet to manufacture it in large enough quantities to prove this. Hypothetically, it could provide body armour that is bulletproof, invisible and almost weightless

Even if the entire Wembley Stadium was covered with graphene, it would be almost invisible, unbreakable and yet strong enough to pick up with one ginger 
### Composite Materials: 

>[!info] Definition
>Composite materials are materials that are made up of a fusion of two or more materials to create an enhanced material with improved properties; an example is Carbon Fibre. Which is incredibly durable, and light 

#### Fibre-based composites: 

**Fibre based composites** are materials that have been reinforced with fibres. For example, by mixing resin or concrete with fibres of glass or carbon we can mould complex shapes, reinforcing them with fibres makes them very strong. 

|Fibre-based composite|Materials|Uses|
|---|---|---|
|Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP)|Glass fibres and resin|Boats, instrument cases|
|Carbon-reinforced plastic (CRP)|Carbon fibre and resin|Formula 1 car bodies, crash helmets, sports equipment|
|Glass-reinforced concrete (GRC)|Glass fibre and concrete|Street furniture, urban features|
#### Particle-based composites

Small material particles are used to create particle-based composites. Larger aggregate, such stones, and smaller sand particles combined yield a very dense and robust material that can be used to build massive structures.

|Particle-based composite|Materials|Uses|
|---|---|---|
|Concrete|Cement, sand and aggregate|Buildings, street furniture|
|Cermet|Ceramic (cer) and metal (met)|Electronic components that need to operate under very hot temperatures|
#### Sheet-based Composites: 

Large sheets of sheet-based composites are frequently offered. Large, sturdy sheets for furniture panels and interior construction can be created by combining resin with thin slices of wood veneer or wood fibres.

|Sheet-based composite|Materials|Uses|
|---|---|---|
|Medium-density fibreboard (MDF)|Wood pulp and resin|Furniture and interior cladding|
|Plywood|Wood veneers and resin|Furniture and construction|
|Chipboard|Wood chip and resin|Furniture panels and construction|
# Paper & Boards: 

- Paper and boards are sourced from cellulose fibres, that originate from trees and plants
- Paper and board are sold in three forms: 
	- Sheet 
	- Rolls 
	- Ply
- These can have different **Thickness, weight, colour and size**
- The main categories of paper are: 
	- Bleed-proof 
	- Cartridge 
	- Grid 
	- Layout 
	- Tracing 
- The main categories of card are: 
	- Corrugated 
	- Duplex 
	- Foil lined 
	- Foam-core 
	- Ink Jet 
	- Solid White board 
- Different types of paper and board share different properties, such as **flexibility, print-ability and biodegradability**
- Cartridge paper is general purpose, plain, white paper and can be used for basic modelling 
- Duplex board is made from two layers of card that have been bonded together, often with a white exterior layer. It can be given a wax layer to be used for food and drinks packaging 
- Papers and boards have been developed for a lot of different purposes, they can be:
	- textured
	- embossed
	- printed on
	- laminated with other materials to make them waterproof, e.g drinks cartons

# Timbers: 
- Timber is converted to planks and then seasoned, it is converted into planks 
- A range of stock forms are produced from then on, i.e: Boards, square sections, mouldings and dowelling 
- These are sold to customers, categorised by length, width, thickness and diameter 
### Hardwood: 

Ash, beech, birch and oak come from broadly deciduous trees; they are strong, tough and has an open grain.  They are often used in interior wood work and high quality furniture.  

Hardwood comes from trees that can take hundreds of years to grow, leading to it not being sustainable or affordable, the production of it requires us to cut down trees that are centuries old, which leaves animals with a damaged habitat and ecosystem.
### Softwood: 

Softwoods, like Cedar, Larch and Pine. Come for coniferous, evergreen trees; they are typically medium weight, easy to work with and have good strength and elasticity. 

Whilst softwoods still require a tree to be chopped down, they come from much faster growing coniferous trees that only need up to 70 years to be fully grown, making them more sustainable and affordable. However, they offer less strength and do not give the same aesthetic appeal of hardwoods 

### Manufactured Boards: 

Manufactured boards are made from wood fibres or veneers that are glued together, an example being MDF. It is typically used in interior panelling and flat-pack furniture. 

Manmade boards are most sustainable, as they do not require as much forest to be cleared in order for them to be produced, however they do not always offer the durability of natural woods and cannot compare to the aesthetic appeal of a natural hardwood grain.
