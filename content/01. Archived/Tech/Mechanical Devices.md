>[!info] Types of Motion
>Mechanical devices always consist of an input motion: which then transforms a force into an output motion . There are four main types of motion: 
>- Linear 
>- Rotary 
>- Reciprocating 
>- Oscillating 

- **Linear motion:** moves something in a straight linear 
- **Rotary Motion:** Is when something moves around on an axis or spinning point 
- **Reciprocating motion:** Consists of a repeated up or down/ back and forth motion 
- **Oscillating Motion:**  A curved backwards and forwards movement

>[!context] Mechanical Advantage
>Levers use mechanical advantage to make lifting/ applying pressure to things easier. All levers are made of a bar and a pivot called a fulcrum. Levers have three main parts: 
>- Effort: This is the amount of force applied by the user, it can also be known as the **input** 
>- Fulcrum: Where the lever pivots 
>- Load: The weight that needs to be moved, this can also be referred to as the **output**

Levers provide mechanical advantage, which is the amount of assistance you get while using a machine vs doing something by hand.  
  
	It can alternatively be expressed as the output (load) divided by the input (effort), and is calculated by dividing the load by the effort required to move it. Both quantities are measured in Newtons (N).

>[!tip] Calculation: 
>$$\text{Mechanical Advantage} = \frac{\text{Load(N)}}{\text{Effort(N)}}$$
