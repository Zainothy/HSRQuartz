# Concept: 

>[!context] Context: 
>The goal is to make managing tasks and revision less overwhelming by providing the student in question with an element of surprise/randomness to what they have to get done. I decided that this could be done through a random board game. 

The general concept takes inspiration from a board game where: 
The Student creates a set of cards adhering to the GCSE specification that is respective to the edition of the revision set. After they’ve created a deck of topics, each deck divided by subject. They will be placed respectively next to a place on the board that matches the subject (e.g: Romeo & Juliet flashcards are placed at the English lit space on the board). Where the student lands is what they have to revise, on the space there will be a box with QR code which will direct the student into an application/website where they can upload their revision resources, or choose from a predefined selection. 

After asking a [[Target Market and Client Interview|student questions]] I decided to create a design specification withholding to the materials described in the interview. 
# Potential Challenges/Flaws: 
- Students are from perfect at managing their own tasks, may require parental intervention for efficient usage 
- The web interface/ application may be a challenge or an outright roadblock 
- Not appealing to students, many aren’t keen on revising: would have to be marketed towards parents 
- Majority made out of paper, may be aesthetically unappealing or be viewed as cheaply made 
# Specification: 
## Materials: [^1]
- Cardboard, Duplex board, white core paper 
- Cards would be made from silk card stock 
## Aesthetics: 
- Hand drawn/ look feel: minimalist 
## Manufacturing: 
- Usage of Nets for the boards and printed cards for the revision cards 
## Size:
- Similar in size to a typical board game board, maybe slightly smaller (12’* 12’) 
- Cards will be about 70x90mm
## Customer: 
- Teenager undergoing GCSEs: ~14-17 
- **Target For Advertising:** Parents with said teenager 
## Environment: 
- Entirely recycled paper and card, any metals or wood added to the design would also be recycled. No plastic would be used in the product 
## Safety: 
- Straightforward, as it is just a board card and a few other pieces, but precautions taken in case of younger children in the household would be: 
	-  Smaller Parts are not choking hazards 
	- There is no risk of large paper cuts from the board 
	- Made from non-toxic stock forms of paper and card
