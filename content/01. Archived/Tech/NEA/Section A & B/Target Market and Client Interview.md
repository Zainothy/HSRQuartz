Q1: What Materials are Preferable to you in a board game?
*A1: I like hardwoods to be used when possible, but for a board gamee: I would prefer smoother forms of board and paper (e.g the stock form used for playing cards) or duplex board.* 
Q2: What usually stops you from revising effectively? 
*A1: A lot of the time it will be distractions, but when it is not: I have no idea where to start, what content I need to go over and no idea where to get good revision resources. Sometime we’ll be provided stuff by teachers, but it’s not always helpful in practice.*
Q3: Do you think a system that were to manage information for you and help you decide what topics to pick would be helpful to the average student?
*A3: Absolutely, most students are either put off by having to put a lot of effort into finding information relating to the spec they’re studying when revision is already quite the effort for the average student.*
Q4: What are some features that put you off a board game product?  
*A4:I do not like the use of obnoxious, over-saturated colours and dislike excessive use of cheap plastic*
Q5: What aesthetics do you love to see in a product? 
*A5: I like a bespoke feel to the aesthetics of a product. Sometimes I like a minimalist approach (e.g Hand-drawn look and feel) or light colour palettes that compliment each other well*
