## Prerequisites:
- Completion of [[Learning CSharp  Documentation (Docs on Notion)]]
- Completion of [[Learning Git]]
- Completely fulfill [[Understanding UI Design]]

## Ideas:
## Onboarding (Formerly known as quick setup)

    The Time that the orginal quick setup
    would've taken to be fulfilled was
    ridiculous, I have decided 

#### Premise:

**Will allow easy setup for ryujinx and it's config.**

### Basic breakdown of implementation:

- **Upon open there will be a dialogue window "Hello, welcome to Ryujinx." the user will press continue** 
- **They will be prompted "Would you like to undergo a setup process" **
- **If yes, the following steps may go through, else: the setup will skip and the user will be given the end prompt: **
   > "Finished, have fun using Ryujinx, if you would like to Support the project: please visit the [Ryujinx Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ryujinx)"**
- **The user will be asked to specify a directory for their Firmware zip file**
- **The function used to install FW from a .zip will then be called**
- **There will be a new prompt saying "Please select your keys files"**
- **They will then be imported to the standard keys directory**
- **The User will then be prompted "Please select your games folder", that will then be set as a game directory**
- **The user will be prompted "What Graphics Backend would you like to use" Followed by a Multiple choice dialogue window** 
- **The user will then be prompted "Setup Finished, have fun using Ryujinx, if you would like to Support the project: please visit the [Ryujinx Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ryujinx)"**
