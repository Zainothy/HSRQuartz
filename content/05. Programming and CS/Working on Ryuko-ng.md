## Tasks: 

- **Implement a context system for macros**


## Context System for macros:

### Premise: 

**When an admin creates a macro it will no longer be a system of ``.ma {Key} {content}``
it will be ``.ma {key} {content} {context}``, the context field will then be called when a user sends `.macros` to the bot in DM's there will be the name of the macro and the context of it next to it after a colon e.g Ava: Provides with Ava download links and FAQ's 

## Challenges: 

- **Understanding Git, and the workflow surrounding it
- **Properly understanding the way that Ryukos code is structured**
- **Properly Understanding Threading in Python**
- 


[[Learning CSharp  Documentation (Docs on Notion)]] has given me some insight, despite the fact that they are different programming languages.
