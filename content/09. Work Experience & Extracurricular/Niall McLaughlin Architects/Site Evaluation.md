>[!context] Background and Goal: 
>The site is an open outdoor terrace, it has a few tables and chairs. It's usage is entirely dependent on the weather, this makes it underutilized when faced with gloomy weather: a common occurrence in this country. When it is used, it is typically used as a space for eating and socializing.
>>[!tip] Goals: 
>>- make the terrace much more versatile and remove its dependence on the weather 
>>- make it have a more 'cosy' atmosphere, and bring a more people-friendly approach to an indoor/outdoor space 
>>- ensure that I **do not** intrude on the external environment and make it as easy on the eyes as possible

## Vision: 
- I plan to use stilts to elevate a room above the terrace, the terrace can then be revamped and lined with ambient lighting to be used as a secondary outdoor space 
- The room above will be almost entirely comprised of [[Smart glass|smart glass]], this glass allows for a communal space that is usable in all types of weather, whilst still not isolating individuals from the outside wall, when an electric current is run through the glass, it then turns opaque. This means that at the flick of a switch, we can allow people within the room to remove a view of the outside world and when the weather is better, the room can be switched back to a mode where only natural light is used 
-  The room will be connected to the terrace by a spiral staircase, this staircase will be one of Manarâ€™s design.
- A slanted roof will be used, the roof will stop at a 1.5 meter section, where there is space for balcony or roof planters.
