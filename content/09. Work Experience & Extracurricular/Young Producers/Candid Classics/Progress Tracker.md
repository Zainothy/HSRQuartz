### Technical Evaluation: 
>[!warning] Issues: 
> ![[Studio Layout]] 
>#### Studio Issues:
The above diagram highlights the issues we are currently facing: 
> - The sheer amount of cables is too much, adding to clutter and makes things harder to manage. 
> - The general environment is cluttered and lacks the atmosphere needed to host a professional podcast 
> - Audio quality itself is fine, but it is easily disrupted by external sound and the room is not dampened enough 
> - Chairs are not ideal for guests or hosts, especially when trialling and doing cuts and retakes for long time 
> #### Technical Issues: 
> - Host needs more control
> - Fizzling, popping breathing etc, diminish mic quality 
> - Improper cable management 
> - Data and Project management framework not established 


## Solutions and Brainstorming: 

After consulting many people, and doing some research. I managed to find a viable or at least sensible solution to each issue that we are plagued with. 

- **Cable Management:** 
	-  [Extend 3.5mm cables](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01CNAV1K2/) from headphones and run them along floors using [Cable raceways](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08P4JYKFS). Along with this, the XLR cables will be run through this and a Snake cable will be used <u>if necessary</u>
	- Cables are tied off using cable ties and such 
	- [Cable Grommets](https://www.amazon.co.uk/JZK-Metal-Grommet-Computer-Management/dp/B0855DV1R2/) drilled into table and cables run out of it 
- **Optimal Filming Environment:**
	-  We switch from the NHT-100M Headsets and transition to IEM’s (In Ear Monitors), which will provide a much more lightweight low profile and less aesthetically intrusive solution for audio prompting. Along with this, audio quality won’t be sacrificed **and** Harvey will be provided with spare headphones that he can use at the desk 
	- We purchase things like [RGB Strips](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09C3RSZ7Q/), [RGB Panels](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BVR1LM63/) to create a camera-ready environment 
	- Proper cable management will also provide the space needed for things like filming lights 
	- Better chairs would be nice but not strictly necessary. 
- **Sound/Audio:**
	- [Acoustic Panels](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0C8HBWM2H) used to line windows and non-dampened areas in studio 
	- [Pop Filters](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CZM5427D/) will prevent any sounds of debris hitting mic or popping when someone is speaking 
	- A Macro Pad, like the [Stream Deck](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09738CV2GK) would allow the host to take control of the audio efficiently without disrupting the recording or creating the need for changes in post production when linked up to the adobe audition software correctly 
	- A noise gate and Noise supression need to be setup in post production or in audio post-processing to prevent random sounds being picked up by the Microphones 
- **Technical/Digital:** 
	- ~~Multi-Track recording needs to be setup in order to allow control over every individual mic and audio channel in post production, giving fine control over audio and allowing for an easier editing experience
	- **File Management:** We will need a 500GB SSD or above in order to centralise projects and editing, a 64gb SD card for backing up projects that are moving around from the Rode a lot and an HDD for archival in the long term 
	- **Project and Task Management:** I have decided to setup a GitHub repository, this repo will have all of the PDF exports of these notes on it and the
