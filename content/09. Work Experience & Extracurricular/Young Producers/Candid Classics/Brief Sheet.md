### Context: 
>[!info] What, Why, etc.
>Candid Classics is a podcast hosted by the Orchestra of The Age of Enlightenment, here at Acland Burghley. Crispin (CEO of The OAE) has given Me (Zain), Mikey, Jess and Harvey a lot of control over the podcast and how we run it. After deciding that me and Mikey host together, we decided that we needed a co-host who was good at listening and engaging in a natural conversation. Along with this, we all agreed that with two boys as the co-hosts, its probably best we don’t bring in a third. 
># Roles: 
>- Zain: Host of The Podcast, Co-Hosting with Mikey 
>- Jess, Harvey: Producers, keeping everything in check (Doing all the work) 

## Plan: 
After setup, we will do a trial run of the Podcast where we will try and figure out whether the podcast is the right fit for you. Make sure to let one of us know if you feel that the podcast is not your thing, if it feels awkward to you, etc. If this is the case, we’ll rule you out and consider other options. 

Now, the trial run will consist of a ‘fake’ recording of a podcast episode, if you want: we won’t record you. Do keep in mind that in future if you choose to continue with the podcast, you <u>may</u> have to be recorded. In the trial run, we will follow a line of questioning with a pretend interview subject, don’t overthink questioning: just keep it conversational and natural. 

**NOTE:** <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">One rule to always abide by on this</mark>, <u>if you do not know what someone is talking about: ask.</u> Go about this as quickly as you can: 
e.g. <u>’Sorry can I stop you for a second, what is [Subject]’</u>

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">The podcast isn’t about knowing a lot about classical music or music in general: </mark>

Crispin’s goal when coming up with the podcast was allowing us to speak our truths, ask questions that you wouldn’t expect, and to follow a non-linear approach to interviewing. 

### Summary: 

**Don’t stress, this is a trial run. Just approach the interview with the subject like a casual conversation and just follow up with questions. Remember, always ask when you don’t know something.** 

## What Next? 

**After Trial:** If you feel like you are confident with continuing as a host, and we feel that you are a good fit for it. You will be invited to take part in the recording of episodes where we want you present, we will keep you updated with when episodes will be recorded, who we will be recording with and how long it may take.
