## Role of the Operating System:

 **“Operating System”- (OS) A software that controls a computers resources, both hardware & software. It allows applications to have direct access to the system hardware, but most software has not been designed to interact with every piece of hardware, therefore the OS takes care of these interactions.**



The earliest Computers had no OS, every program had to be programmed in a complex manor that allowed it to interact with the hardware. This made programs much harder to create. These  days, OS’ are prevalent, with part of their role being to include the necessary programming for software to run on the computer. This allows for developers to have an easier time when making programs that run a computer. 

Whether the OS is custom written, or a well known standard OS, they all have a similar role that keep things running well: 

- Processor Management
- Inputs, outputs and interrupts
- Memory management
- Security

## Processor Management:

When you open a program on a computer, the OS makes sure that all hardware is processing the correct instructions at the right point in time. In order for this to be done, it finds the appropriate data first from the secondary storage and offloads it onto the main memory. A computer with a single processor core can only carry one process each time; however, the OS will schedule tasks to swap in and out of the processor so that it appears to the user that the computer is carrying out multiple tasks. 

For example, allowing you to listen to a music track from an online service while also using a word processor at the same time. This is known as multi-tasking, most modern computers have multiple cores which allows for more efficient multi tasking as each core can carry out a process.
