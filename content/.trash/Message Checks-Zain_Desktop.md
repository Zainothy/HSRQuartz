### I have now decided that I will do four checks before sending message: 
-  **Am I in the right Channel
- **Am I using the correct tone for said channel 
- **Is what I'm Saying potentially annoying or dumb 
- **Is what I'm saying politcally correct 
- **Is it factually Correct**
**
*if these checks do not return ` True, True, False, True` then the message wil not go through*
