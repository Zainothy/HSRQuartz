## Key Events:
**Yesterday evening an air traffic control fail lead to the cancellation of our flight, we are currently stuck in Greece until the 31st and have expended a substantial amount of money in the process of booking a new flight. 
The air traffic control failure was caused by an incorrectly formatted flight plan, this caused the system to no longer work automatically and all flight traffic control was working manually, meaning that traffic was significantly rate limited.
