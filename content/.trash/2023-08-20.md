## Done Today: 

- **Today I properly setup and configured the new PC build, everything is working like a charm: 
	Ryzen 9 7900x, RTX 4090, 64gb DDR5 4800 CL40 
	I am very happy with the results of this build. 
	The new build will help to aid me in many of my tasks, such as [[Learning CSharp  Documentation (Docs on Notion)]] or [[Working on Ryuko-ng]]]
