**UNBRICKING 101**

- # Section 1 : LCs
- → You aren't required to run DHIL and FF at the same time, just share Aeon \
- → Why are Welt Sig and Yanqing cones leveled? Waste of Resources 
- → Level the listed LCs to 70 first before bringing them to 80 
- → Pls Level up important LCs: (Atleast to 70+)
- ~~→ QPQ~~ (70)
- ~~→ Post-Op~~ (70)
- ~~→ Cogs~~ (70)
- → Motp(60)
- → Geniuses' Repose (30)
- → Breakfast (60)
- → EOTP (ur using Ach Pela Gui) 
- → Boat (if u plan on using Ratio)
- # Section 2 : Traces to Level and Max 
- → Level the Important Traces to 10 FIRST for each char
- → After doing that, come back to level the other traces to 10 as well 
- → Ex. Level 10 HH ult, then level another important trace (such as RM ult to 10) before coming back to level HH skill and talent to 10
- # Section 3 : Resource Management in the Future 
- → Stop leveling so much Chars and LCs you won't use in the future, ur account isnt in a position to do this ( too little resources) 
- → Make sure you know how long a unit you level will last and MAX them out, no cutting corners
- # Section 4 : Recommended Pulls 
- → Robin ( Sig too) → Acorn Sig → RM Sig → Ratio Sig ( if u wanna use him) 
- → Eids ( E1 Robin, E1 RM, E2 Ach (if u commit))
