## Supports: 
## For: 
- **Robin:** She saw a slow start on initial release, being seen as strictly a fua unit: but she's proven to be the best limited harmony of all time. Working in 90% of dps team comps, she is must pull for those who don't have her and I highly advise pulling e1 for any1 with savings/ has her at e0 as it is one of the most broken e1's in the game
- **Ruan Mei:** Absolute classic, the first limited harmony and still one of the best, outperforming robin on certain teams and synergising with her amazingly.
- **Tingyun:** One of the best four stars in the game at e6 and still worth building at e0, providing stellar damage amp, energy regeneration and when running DDD, teamwide advance forward.
## Against:
- **Sparkle:**  whilst gaining a quick start on her release, I and many other meta players have noticed she is the weakest of the three limited harmony units. Her damage amp is underwhelming compared to that of rm or robins, and her cdmg buffs can be unhelpful when a unit is highly invested. she is outperformed in almost every team by rm/robin. Only beating them in Dhil teams, qq teams and acheron teams. Even then, dhil and acheron prefer robin when properly setup.

**However:** For the dolphins and small spenders here, or even the f2ps if you have saved enough. Sparkle at E2 can provide crazy amp, potentially outperforming RM and Robin. As E1 Provides a 40% Teamwide ATK buff, and E2 Provides 24% Defence ignore when fully stacked. 
If you really like sparkle, go for it: but sparkle at e2 is typically outperformed by robin at E1
## Sustains: 
### For:
- **Aventurine**: One of the strongest sustains in the game, offering teamwide shield and excellent SP positivity when built right, along with this he offers 50% teamwide effect res. And, when built properly: boasts decent damage. Highly reccomend for anyone with robin or acheron, and general usage 
- **Huohuo:** Whilst her utility has fallen off lately, she is seeing a comeback, being BiS for yunli at s1. Her teamwide energy regen and atk buffs make her an excellent choice for energy hungry teams, being incredible for teams like JL, dhil, yunli, etc.
- **Gallagher:** Easily hoyos best four star, outperforming both fu xuan and luocha in utility. Providing teamwide break buffs, atk reduction, dmg vulnerability and excellent sustain. Being the BiS sustain for all break teams, best for apoc shadow and choir in MoC and Being acherons best f2p option. A must build for most players

### Against: 
- **Luocha:** Being incredibly old, he provides absolutely nothing other than a truckload of heals. He has no util to the team whatsoever apart from a buff removal from the enemies on ultimate and some sp positivity, that of which Gallagher can match if not outperform thanks to his 100% advance after ult. I do not recommend Luocha in **any** circumstance whatsoever. 
- **Fu Xuan:** Yes, she is one of the strongest sustainers in the game, but when faced with AoE content she immediately struggles, and only delays the inevitable. Her 12% CR is nice, but it is not worth a whole ass unit, units shouldn't be used to compensate for poor builds for the average player. Along with this, in content with a large amount of crowd control debuffs, her field can often not be enough to protect against them. Ultimately, not worth the pulls when she is this old
## DPS: 
**PSA**:
 I firmly believe that most of the time, a unit shouldn't be pulled if you do not plan to vertically invest in them, E0S1/E1S0 being ideal for most DPS. The only exceptions to this being FF and Boothill. Not vertically investing in units (apart from sustains) is a bad idea, even as an f2p. Take the time to save and skip units you don't need and instead vertically invest into ones you do need/ want. 

### For: 
- **Yunli:** At E0S1, Yunli has the potential to outperform both Acheron and Firefly, offering an incredibly high damage ceiling and being relatively easy to build. She is reliable for all three game modes, making her a great pull 
- **Boothill:** Easily the strongest DPS in the game, no competition. Outperforming Acheron, Firefly, Yunli, everyone. His scaling makes him incredibly future proof and his lack of reliance on HTB making his team comps more flexible. Harder to play than FF, much higher Ceiling. An excellent pull, without a doubt.
- *Acheron:* (at risk of being moved down): both sides of MoC not being incredibly good for her and AS being completely lightning resistant. At E0S1 she has a very good damage ceiling but an easy to break kit, and at E0S0 she is a complete fraud, offering incredibly slow damage which can sometimes even be underwhelming. In the current meta: she is not worth pulling without both E0S1 and JQ 
### Against:
- **Firefly:** I know everyone loves her, I like her too: but she is the inferior break DPS, with a much lower ceiling than BH and being much more easily broken/crept, however she offers an incredible ammount of damage, and is the best unit for AS
- Blade: Lacking in supports, scaling and damage. Overall, bottlenecked entirely by his old ass kit 
- **Jingliu:** Offering a decent damage ceiling, but has aged like milk at eos1. As she lacks good supps, despite robin being an upgrade.
- **DHIL:** At E0S1, Dhil is an absolutely underwhelming unit, purely because of his age. I would only reccomend this units at e2, minimum.

## DPS Part 2: 
### For: 
- **Himeko:** In the current meta, she is incredibly good in both MoC and PF. As a superbreak build in MoC even has the potential to 0 cycle; however, once Choir disappears from MoC I am sure this will not be the case, she is under watch for now
- **Herta:** Synergises incredibly with Himeko, whilst being non-functional in MoC she is a must build for PF. 
- **Clara:** Whilst being outperformed by Yunli, and whilst being a 1.0 unit. She is still viable, and decent in this MoC with Robin, and can offer a decent damage ceiling; especially with Eidolons. 

### Against: 
- **Seele:** Whilst being decent at high investment, I can not recommend that anyone pull such a dated unit, typically: DPS are almost never worth it on rerun, currently the only exceptions to this are Acheron, Boothill and Potentially FF (reasons why FF is discouraged in favour of Boothill already explained) 
- **Jing Yuan:** Having some of the most backloaded damage in the game makes him incredibly difficult to play, and whilst he has been buffed by many new releases. He still lacks performance, even when he released he did. 

### I mean, eh: 
- **Qingque:** Don't come after me, shes fun, shes cool; but she is INCREDIBLY RNG reliant, making her inconsistent and often tilting. Along with this, she is incredibly reliant on Sparkle, which is not ideal considering Sparkle's lack of performance compared to the other two limited harmonies. 
- **Welt:** Whilst having a decent damage ceiling, he is inredibly hard to build and overall , much worse than even free options. Do not recommend 
- **Jade:** Despite being the best PF unit in the entire game, when removed from this game mode she suffers. Lacking damage and lacking enough enemies to do anything with,  this isn't ideal for a limited five star when almost identical performance can be achieved with herta+himeko.

## Specialists: 
### For: 
- **Jiaoqiu:** Easily one of the best debuffers in the game, offering tremendous damage vulnerability and decent personal damage. With high EHR and SPD requirements. This can make him hard to build: but is an absolute essential for Acheron mains, offering a damage boost comparable to that of her Signature light cone and potentially even her E2 when he is at E0S1. However, his use immediately declines without Acheron 
- **Pela:** Some of the strongest defence shred in the game, only outperformed by Silver Wolfs. She makes up for this by having AoE defence shred, making her an incredible acheron teammate and providing decent amp to some units like JL, with her Ice res reduction on skill. Definitely worth building 
- **Topaz:** Topaz, I both love and hate. She is in both sections because of this, at E1S1 she boasts decent damage and provides the debuffs necessary to proc ratio's follow up attack plenty. Along with this, she works incredibly well on FUA teams like IPC. 
### Against: 
- **Topaz:** At E0S0, she has the potential to be one of the worst five stars in the game. Providing not enough damage, not enough debuffs and no utility to the team. At this investment level, she is nothing more than a pitiful placeholder 
- **Silver Wolf:** Yes, her defence shred is good. Yes, she implants weakness. Shes old, single target and incredibly demanding in terms of EHR, and ult uptime, she is showing her age and just isn't worth spending pulls on when Jiaoqiu and Pela exist. If you have her, well thats fine: but she is simply no longer worth it 
- **Kafka and Swan:** These two units will be included together because of how they are symbiotically reliant on each other. Now if you want a tldr, DoT is shit; it lacks high damage ceiling and is held back a LOT by Kafka and her age as a unit, along with this it is INCREDIBLY reliant on eids and sigs. Possibly one of the most expensive teams, requiring RM, HH, BS E1, Kafka S1 at the bare minimum.
