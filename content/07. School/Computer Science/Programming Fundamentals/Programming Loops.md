**Loops are an essential part of programming and are an example of iteration statements. These statements repeat a part of a program, as the name implies.** 
# For Loops: 


> [!context] Explanation 
><mark class="hltr-pink"> For loops are an example of a Count-Controlled Loop</mark>, meaning that <mark class="hltr-blue">they will repeat a fixed number of times</mark>, and then stop: this number of times is dependent on the conditions set for it: these conditions consist of an initial value and an end value. 
>
>These values donâ€™t have to be predefined either, they can be set as the program runs, an example being using a variable as an end value
>


# <mark class="hltr-purple">Do Until</mark> & <mark class="hltr-red">While Loops</mark>: 


> [!example] Do Until
> - Controlled by a condition at the end of the loop
> - Continue until the condition is true
> - Always run the code within the loop at least once 
> - If the condition is never true, the code is an infinite loops 


> [!danger] While: 
> - Controlled by a condition at the start of the loops 
> - Keep going while the condition is true (i.e. until it is false).
> - Never run the code inside them if the condition is initially false.
>  You get an infinite loop if the condition is always true.

**Both of these loops are examples of Condition Controlled Statements**
