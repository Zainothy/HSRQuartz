>[!context] Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty 2: 
>This treaty was under negotiation since 1972, the superpowers agreed to limit their nuclear arsenal to a maximum of 2250 warheads. Salt 2 was different from SALT 1 in the sense of what it counted, SALT 1 simply counted missiles and bombers. Whereas two accounted for warheads.

## How Successful was SALT 2 & SALT 1? 
![[SALT 2 and 1 Failures+Strengths]]

- West German politicians opposed the treaty, as they feared it weakened their defences. They felt that after SALT, the USA would be less likely to use nuclear force to defend West Germany 
- Some US politicians believed that it was too soft on the Soviets and made too many “concessions” 
- US-Soviet Relations soured after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 because of this, the senate never ratified the treaty and it therefore never became an official US policy.
