>[!context] # Background: 
>During the late 1960s, around 1968: the Soviet Union sent tanks into Czechoslovakia to supress a violent revolution, known as the Prague Spring. The USA condemned this violent suppression of an uprise, but didn’t intervene. 
>
>Later on, in 1979: the Soviet Union deployed troops into Afghanistan, a country which was facing a communist uprising. The Soviets sent troops in with the goal of taking control of the country after the president’s assassination. This soured superpower relations severely and caused the USA to react very strongly. 

## Soviets Invade Afghanistan:
- The Soviet Union saw the nation as a <mark class="hltr-red">part of the Soviet sphere of influence</mark>, as it was bordering them. This incentivized the USSR to want to create a Soviet-Backed, communist government. 
- When<mark class="hltr-pink"> Taraki was assassinated </mark>during a civil war, and was <mark class="hltr-purple">replaced by Hafizullah Amin: The USSR felt that it was losing its influence on the nation </mark>
- In December of 1979, Brezhnev ordered that Soviet troops invade Afghanistan. During this invasion, Barbrak Karmal was made president and Amin, along with his supporters: was killed
	- Brezhnev and other Soviet politicians, believed that Amin was a spy. 

# Consequences of The Invasion: 
>[!tip] The Carter Doctrine: 
>- Carter threatened to use force if the Soviet Union attempted to take control of the Persian Gulf
>- The USA imposed heavy economic sanctions on the USSR, there would be no trade or aid provided the the USSR. Meaning that they would no longer export Grain or import oil. 
>- The USA and its Asian allies, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan provided direct aid to the Mujahedeen. This meant that the USA was directly funding a war between Afghanistan and The Soviet Union 
>- The USA ceased to be cooperative with the USSR, and began a confrontational stance towards it 

### The Olympic Boycotts: 
One direct consequence of the invasion was the USA’s boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow. As a result of this, The Soviet Union boycotted The 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. 

This signified an end to [[Détente in the 1970s|Detente]] and brough to an end any form of cooperation between the two superpowers

### Further Consequences: 
###### Americans: 
- Lead to many Americans taking an anti-communist stance
- Catalysed the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, who was a hard-line anti-communist who promised to be incredibly reactionary towards the USSR. 
###### Soviets: 
- Soviet troops had to remain in Afghanistan to keep Barbrak Karmal in power. 
	- Troops came under repeated attack from the Mujahedeen, which lead to rising casualties from both parties
	- Pressure increased on the Soviets to stop the war
