# The DAP: 

- Founded by **Anton Drexler** in February 1919 
	- He was a railway mechanic from Munich 
	- His party started slow, in September 1919: it had 23 members 
	- It was a right wing party targeted towards the working classes 
- The government hired Hitler to spy on political parties in Munich 
	- Threats from extremist parties were a struggle from the Weimar Republic because of peoples lack of trust in them 
- Hitler attended his first meeting of the **DAP on 12th September 1919**
    - The ideas discussed at the meeting aligned with Hitler’s personal beliefs
    - On **19th September 1919, Hitler signed up as a member**
        - This went against his government **assignment**

# The DAP’s Reform: 

By 1920, the DAP had changed it’s name to the Nationalist Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP or Nazi Party). Hitler managed to control and reform the NSDAP in many ways:

- [[The Reform of the Nazi Party#The Twenty-Five Point Programme|25 Point Programme]]: A set of policies created by Hitler for the party 
- Hitlers personal appeal to people, he was seen as charismatic and convincing 
- He then moved on to develop the party to have an organisational structure, improving efficiency
- He **forced a change of leadership** and chose members for key positions 
- He founded the SA (Stormtroopers): the NSDAP’s very own private army

# The Twenty-Five Point Programme: 

>[!info] Hitlers Plan
>- Hitler became the NSDAPs chief of propaganda, when this happened: he realised the party needed an official document stating its policies. 
>- The DAP had voiced its views on key issues such as: 
> 	 - The **removal of Weimar politicians** who had signed the **Treaty of Versailles**
> 	   - The **rewriting of the Weimar** **Constitution** and restrictions on **democracy**
> 	   - The **blaming of the Jewish people** for all of Germany’s issues

- So **in January 1920**, Hitler and Drexler rewrote the Twenty-Five Point Programme, which formalised the aims of the DAP
