# Some Political Context: 

### Political Spectrums: 
- People’s political opinions fall on a **spectrum**
    - They assess their belief in freedom and equality to judge if they are politically ‘left’ - closer to communism - or politically ‘right’ - closer to fascism
    - There are many other political beliefs between the left and right. **Anarchy** is the **rejection of any laws** or rules in society. **Socialism** is similar to communism but allows some **state-run businesses and a government** to exist

	- The extreme left and extreme right parties **attacked the coalition governments** in the Reichstag. The extremists had the power to cause disruption
