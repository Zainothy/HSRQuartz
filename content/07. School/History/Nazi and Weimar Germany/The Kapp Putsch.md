![[The Spartacist Uprising#Some Political Context]]
# The Kapp Putsch of 1920:

>[!info] The Freikorps:
>The freikorps were incredibly dangerous, they were a para-military organisation with full access to their weapons, along with this: they were an incredibly right wing organisation, this conflicted with the current modern governments views 

- After having supressed the communists, Ebert feared the power of the Freikorps. They were still angry about the armistice and felt Germany had been wronged.
	- Along with this, they possessed great strength in numbers, with over 250,000 members of the Freikorps
- **March 1920:** Frederick Ebert planned on disbanding the Freikorps units in Berlin, however: fearing unemployment, 5000 members attempted to overthrow the government
	- They announced a right wing politician: **Wolfgang Kapp** as their leader. After this, Ebert attempted to use General Seeckt (head of the Reichswher), to stop the Freikorps. Seeckt saw the Freikorps as fellow soldiers, and refused to attack them. 

### Freikorps Success: 

- At this point, the Freikorps had successfully captured Berlin and the government was forced to flee to the towns of Weimar and Stuttgart 
- However, Kapp and the Freikorps made a grave mistake: they declared that they would be re-inviting the Kaiser to govern Germany 
	- The Working Classes did not support the Kaisers return as king and as a result of this, called for a general strike 
	- Berlin lost gas, electricity, water and public transport 
**After four days, Kapp left Berlin**: He couldnâ€™t govern without essential services, so he fled to Sweden. 

- By 1922, Kapp returned to stand trial for conspiracy and treason, but died the day before the trial began.
