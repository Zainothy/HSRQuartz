# German Reaction to The Treaty of Versailles: 

The Treaty of Versailles is one of the most hated treaties in history. The reasoning behind this is because of how every single country that signed the agreement: came out feeling unhappy with the outcome, especially Germany. 

The final agreement left everyone unsatisfied, and all issues unresolved: it is no wonder as to why it was so unpopular. **The Allies banned Germany from attending peace talks in 1919**, so the Weimar Republic had no choice but to sign the treaty, this led to a large amount of outcry from the Germany Public: and this hatred towards the TOV continued into even the late 1930’s, which Hitler utilised as a way to win the people. 
>[!context] The Treaties signing: 
><mark class="hltr-red">The ‘Big Three’ of Britain, France and the USA met at the Palace of Versailles in January 1919, all different intentions</mark>.
>
>**Clemenceau, France’s PM**: wanted the TOV to be as harsh on Germany as possible. <mark class="hltr-purple">France and Germany had fought multiple times during the 19th century, Germany had taken away key areas from it: including, Alsace-Lorraine.</mark> Clemenceau saw the TOV as on oppurtunity to gain back lost territory.

>**Woodrow Wilson, the American President**: <mark class="hltr-green">had completely different views, he wanted to establish a long lasting peace after WWI</mark>. He believed the TOV should embody the ‘14 points’. He didn’t want to cripple Germany, or he wanted to help keep it strong so they could help rebuild Europe. <mark class="hltr-pink">He even wanted Germany to join the League of Nations.</mark> 
>
>**David Lloyd George, The British Prime Minister**: Had an opinion in between that of Clemenceau’s and Wilson’s. Britain had experienced high casualties during the first world war and the British public wanted revenge on Germany. <mark class="hltr-blue">George understood Clemenceau’s disdain towards Germany, as he too had also faced challenged with them before WWI. However, he also agreed with Wilson: Europe needed a strong Germany for its economy. </mark>
