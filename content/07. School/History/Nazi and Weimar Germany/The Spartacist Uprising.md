# Some Political Context: 

### Political Spectrums: 
- People’s political opinions fall on a **spectrum**
    - They assess their belief in freedom and equality to judge if they are politically ‘left’ - closer to communism - or politically ‘right’ - closer to fascism
    - There are many other political beliefs between the left and right. **Anarchy** is the **rejection of any laws** or rules in society. **Socialism** is similar to communism but allows some **state-run businesses and a government** to exist

## Weimar Politics: 
![[Pasted image 20240505170457.png]]
- By **June 1920**, the moderate left and moderate right parties only held **44%** of the seats in the Reichstag
	- In contrast to this, the extreme right and left parties held roughly the same percentage of seats. 
- Germany used <mark class="hltr-pink">Proportional Representation</mark>, meaning that achieving over 50% of votes (the requirement to be in power): is an incredibly difficult task. 
	- Numerous moderate parties were forced to combine in order to gain the majority vote, these coalitions were inefficient and slow to pass legislation. 
	- The extreme left and extreme right parties **attacked the coalition governments** in the Reichstag. The extremists had the power to cause disruption

# The Spartacist Uprising of 1919: 


>[!context] The Spartacists: 
>The Spartacists were a KPD supported, Socialist branch of the USPD led by **Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht**

In January of 1919, the Spartacists attempted to take over Berlin, they took control of important buildings (i.e Newspaper Headquarters). As a result of this, over 50,000 workers went on strike in support of the left wing revolution, this became known as the **Spartacist Uprising**

Ebert was forced to ask for help from the Freikorps (ex German soldiers) to stop the rebellion, during the suppression over 100 workers were killed, even Luxemberg and Liebknecht were killed during this. This uses of violence from the freikorps caused a split between the left Social Democratic party and the communists.
