## The Fuhrer Cult, Propaganda and Censorship: 
Hitler wanted total control over the German way of life, the way people act, think: how they live their life. If he wanted to achieve this, he needed to control the media, information and literature that people consumed. If he controlled information, he had effective control over people's way of thinking. 

**Censorship:**
>[!tip] Why? 
>In order to control the way that people think and enforce a Nazi regime, they first had to prevent any form of opposition: 

- All media, literature, etc. that was considered 'Anti-Nazi' was banned or destroyed: 
	 - Millions of books were burnt: in 1933 over 20,000 books affilated with Judaism and Communism were destroyed in the centre of Berlin. Even the works of Einstein were incenerated
- Any form of Anti-Nazi speech was banned, you could be arrested for telling an Anti-Nazi joke 
- Artists were prohibited from producing anything that didn't promote Nazi ideals, along with this: forms of music like Jazz were banned: as the Nazis saw black culture as inferior 
**The Fuhrer Cult:**
The Nazis wanted to paint Hitler as both a man of the people, and the one above them all. Immense amounts of propaganda was used to paint him as a brave veteran, a proud worker and a person who is fond of children. 	
This was all done in an effort to make the German people idolise Hitler and follow him as if he were their God. 
Throughout Germany, there were pictures of Hitler everywhere and 'Heil Hitler' became the national greeting. Total and utter obedience was embedded into the Nazi way of life.
**Propaganda:** 
Propaganda, information of a biased or misleading nature: used to promote a cause or ideology. This was a fundamental part of totalitarian control over Germany, and was utilised by the Nazis heavily. 
Propaganda was managed by a man named Josef Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda. His goal was to enforce Nazi ideals and create the ideal Nazi Germany. 

Propaganda was enforced in a number of ways, inclusive of: 
- Rallies, Speeches 
- Films 
- Newspapers
- Cultural Identity 
- Radio 
- Events
