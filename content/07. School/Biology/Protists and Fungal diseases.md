> [!question] Protists. What are they:
> Fungi, like plants and animals: are eukaryotic. However, unlike plants and animals, Fungi has both unicellular and multicellular forms. Take Yeast: a unicellular Fungi that can be used to make bread rise. On the other hand Mushroom are a multicellular Fungi with complex thread-like structures. 
> > [!info] Thread-like?
> > This structure is called Hyphae, which usually spreads out of the main body and move through the soil. A small minority of the time, these hyphae can spread over plants and even penetrate skin and cause disease. They can also produce **Spores** which are capable of quickly spreading and even growing into new Fungi.

# Fungal Diseases: 

## Rose Black Spot Disease:

Rose black spot causes purple or black spots to form on the top of the leaf, this impacts roses the most, as implied by the name. As the fungusâ€™ damage starts to progress, leaves may turn yellow or even drop off. This will impact the rate of photosynthesis for the sick plant, and will stunt growth. 

RBC is typically transmitted through the air or through contaminated water, it can be treated by removing the infected leaves, or spraying the plant with fungicides. 

# Protist Diseases:

>[!question] What are Protist Diseases 
>	Protists are similar to Fungi: They are eukaryotic, and have multicellular and unicellular variations. The large majority of them are unicellular; some protists are classed as **Parasites** meaning they live on or inside another organism to survive. A large majority of the time Protists are transported by vectors, meaning: they are carried between different host organisms by other organisms. E.g. Malaria is carried by mosquitoes. 

# Malaria: 
- Malaria will cause symptoms like Fever, fatigue and vomiting
	- Symptoms will be recurrent: they return constantly, in extreme circumstances this is fatal. 
### Combatting Malaria: 

- Destroy Vectors using insecticides 
- Prevent us from being bitten by using bug nets or repellents
