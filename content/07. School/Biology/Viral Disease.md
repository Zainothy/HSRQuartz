> [!question] What is a virus?
> Viruses are <mark class="hltr-purple">non-living organisms that require a host to survive</mark>, once they have a host: they use it to <mark class="hltr-red">reproduce until the cell bursts</mark>, and repeat this process rapidly until they are eradicated by the immune system, or they kill the host. This damage to our bodies makes us feel ill.  

Some examples of <mark class="hltr-pink">viruses are HIV, Measles and Tobacco Mosaic Virus. </mark>
## Measles: 

<mark class="hltr-cyan">Measles is an airborne virus,</mark> it is spread by droplets from coughs and sneezes. Typically, patients will experience a red rash across their body along with a high fever and general fatigue. Measles , when not treated properly, can be really serious, or even fatal. **However, in the UK most people are vaccinated against it at a young age: making it very rare.** 

## HIV: 

<mark class="hltr-red">Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is spread by sexual contact or exchange of bodily fluids </mark>through acts like sharing needles. HIV will attack the immune system, and as the name suggests: it will cause it to perform inadequately. HIV is the term used to refer to the virus; when someone first catches it they will likely experience fever, fatigue and aches. Then, theyâ€™ll start to feel better however, under the surface: irreparable damage is being made to the immune system and when the spread of the virus reaches a certain point the patient <mark class="hltr-pink">will start contract unusual infections and even forms of cancer. </mark>

<mark class="hltr-blue">At this stage, the patient has Auto-Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)</mark>, a syndrome used to describe a failing immune system. This used to be fatal, however now there i<mark class="hltr-yellow">s new medication called antiretroviral drugs that prevent the virus from replicating in our bodies</mark>, this allows AIDS patients to live fairly normal lives. 


## Tobacco Mosaic Virus: 

This virus is <mark class="hltr-green">strictly limited to plants, and only specific ones such as tobacco and tomato plants.</mark> One symptom of this virus is discoloured patches on the leaves in a mosaic pattern, hence the name. **These discoloured patches are where a lack of photosynthesis taking place in the leaf, leading to stunted growth and wilting.**
