> [!question] What are bacteria, and how are they harmful? 
> Bacteria are <mark class="hltr-green">predominantly harmless</mark>, but there are many <mark class="hltr-red">bacteria capable of causing disease</mark>. Bacteria are incredibly small, single celled organisms that often use our bodies as a home due to the plentiful nutrient supply for replication. <mark class="hltr-blue">However, some bacteria in our body may release harmful toxins that makes us feel ill by damaging cells and tissues</mark>. 

## Salmonella:

 Salmonella or food poisoning , is <mark class="hltr-purple">caught from the ingestion of contaminated foods,</mark> typically: Chicken. However it is important to note that, in the UK chickens are<mark class="hltr-green"> vaccinated against Salmonella</mark>, thus reducing the risk of food poisoning from chicken.

Although, if you do happen to be unlucky enough to contract food poisoning: you will experience stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhoea and fever. All of these <mark class="hltr-cyan">symptoms typically pass in a few days</mark>.

## Gonorrhoea: 

Gonorrhoea is an example of a <mark class="hltr-orange">sexually transmitted bacterial disease</mark>. Symptoms typically include: pain during urination, along with a thick yellow/green discharge from the reproductive organs. 



# Prevention and Treatment: 

#### Gonorrhoea: 
- Avoid unsafe sex: use barrier methods 
- Treat: Penicillin, however: penicillin resistance has risen in Gonorrhoea
