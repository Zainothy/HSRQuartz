> [!tip] # Current, Voltage and Resistance 
> Current, denoted by $A$ is the measure of the rate at which charge flows in a circuit. Potential difference, denoted by $V$ is the force that drives charge flow. Resistance, denoted by $\Omega$ is anything that opposes/ resists charge flow. 

# Key Equations: 

$E=P \times t$ - **Energy (E)** = **Power (P)** x **Time (t)**
$E=V\times I\times t$ - **Energy (E)** = **Voltage (V)** x **Current (I)** x **Time (t)**
$E=Q\times V$- **Energy (E)** = **Charge (Q)** x **Voltage (V)**
$P=I\times V$- **Power (P)** = **Current (I)** x **Voltage (V)**
$P=I^2R$ - **Power** = **Current**^2 x **Resistance**
