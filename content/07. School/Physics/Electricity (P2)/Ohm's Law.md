> [!info] Voltage, Resistance and Current
> $V=I\times R$ is one of **the most important physics formulae** in the topic, <mark class="hltr-purple">it links Voltage, resistance and current. </mark>This formula is known as **Ohmâ€™s Law**
> 
> **Worked Example:** 
> If we have a <mark class="hltr-orange">circuit</mark> with a current of $4A$ and a <mark class="hltr-blue">resistance</mark> of $2\Omega$, the volage would be $8V$. 
> 
> Another example is a $24V$ battery producing a current of $8A$. The resistance would be $R=\frac{V}{I}$ which when substituted is $\frac{24}{8}$. This equates to $3\Omega$
