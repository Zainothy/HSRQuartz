# Ions Defined: 

> [!tldr] An Overview of Ions:
> I<mark class="hltr-green">ons are atoms that have gained or lost electrons</mark> through a chemical reaction in order to form a full outer shell. Ions that have gained electrons are actually negative because of the fact that electrons are negative.<mark class="hltr-blue"> Ions that have lost electrons are positive. </mark> 

# C2 Ionic Bonding :

As we know, Ions are formed from the gain or loss of electrons during a chemical reaction. The thing is, these reaction arenâ€™t isolated, they happen between elements and form compounds, lets expand on this: 

- Ions are formed through a transfer of electrons from element to element: for example, an atom that has one too many electrons (like sodium) may transfer an electron to an atom that needs one more to gain a full outer shell (like chlorine). 
	- Once this transfer occurs, they both become ions, Sodium would be a positive ion as it has lost an electron, expressed as: $Na^{1+}$. and chlorine would be $Cl^{1-}$
	- The point here is: they both have opposite charges and are therefore attracted to each other through electrostatic force. This electrostatic force forms an **Ionic Bond**, it is incredibly strong 
## Drawing Ionic Bonds: 

Ionic bonds would be drawn using a **Dot and Cross Diagram**: 
- Electrons are drawn as one atom as dots and the other as crosses to show which electron has swapped to which atom. Electron movement is shown with an arrow. 
- Dot and cross diagrams do not require every shell be drawn typically, only usually the outer shell
