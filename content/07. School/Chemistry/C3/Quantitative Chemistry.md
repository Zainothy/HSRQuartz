# Relative Formula Mass (3.1):

>[!info] Mass Numbers
>Mass numbers, found at the top left of an element on the periodic table: are what allow us to find out the number of protons and neutrons in an element. Sometimes, relative atomic mass will be shown instead which is the average mass of all the isotopes of said element. RAM is denoted by $(A_r)$

This means that while some atoms of element may have mass numbers different to the original, such as $35$ or $37$. Chlorine as an element has a relative atomic mass number of $35.5$

>[!tip] Relative Formula Mass
> What about finding the average mass of a compound? That is relative formula mass; denoted as $M_{r}$. This can be found by adding the **relative atomic masses** of **every atom** in the **Compound’s Molecular Formula**

## Illustrating $M_{r}$ Calculation

![[Quantitative Chemistry Diagram.excalidraw]]

Lets now use this illustration to figure out what the $M_{r}$ of 
$$H_{2}SO_{4}$$

$(2\times1)+(1\times32)+(4\times16)=98$

## Percentage Mass: 

> [!tip] How to calculate percentage mass:
> $${\frac{{A_{r} \text{ of Atom} \times \text{no. of Atoms}}}{{M_{r} \text{ of The compound}}}}\times 100 $$



> [!NOTE] ##### Worked Example 
> % Mass of $O$ in $Ca(OH)_{2}$ 
> $A_{r}$ of Oxygen, Calcium and Hydrogen: 
> - $Ca=40$
> - $O=16$
> - $H=1$
> - $\frac{{(16 \times 2)}}{(40+(2\times16)+(2\times1 ))}$
> - ${\frac{32}{74}}\times 100$
> - = 43.2%


# Moles and Mass (3.2): 

> [!info] Moles
> These are a way of measuring how much of a substance we have. 1 mole of any substance is $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ particles. This number is known as **Avogadro’s Constant**
> >[!tip] Formula: 
> $$The \space Number \space of \space Moles = \frac{{Mass\space of \space Element}}{M_{r}}$$

# Calculating Mass in Reactions (3.3): 

### Worked Example: 

'Calculate the mass of sodium oxide ($Na_{2}O$) that can be made by completely burning 5.0g of sodium (Na) in oxygen. Give your answer to 3 significant figures.'

When you see a question like this, think of there being a **known substance** and an **unknown substance**:
- The **known substance** is the one they've told you the mass of - **in this case the sodium**.
- The **unknown substance** is the one you're trying to find the mass of - **in this case the sodium oxide**.

There are **4 steps** to follow for questions like this:

  

Write out the balanced equation

Find the **moles of the** **known substance** ($Moles=\frac{Mass}{M_{r}}$)

Find the **moles of the** **unknown substance** (using the molar ratio from the balanced equation)

Find the **mass of the unknown substance** ($Mass=Moles\times M_{r}$

So now lets do it: 


> [!NOTE] Working Out
> **Balanced Equation**: 
$4Na + O_{2}\to 2Na_{2}O$
> Find moles of known substance: 
> 	$Moles = \frac{Mass}{M_{r}}$
> 	$Moles=\frac{5}{23}=0.217$
> Find moles of unknown substance: 
> The unknown substance is sodium oxide ($Na_{2}O$), so use the molar ratio to find the moles of $Na_{2}O$
> $$4Na + O_{2} \to 2Na_{2}O\space,
> Therefore\space Ratio = 2:1$$
> So divide the moles of Na by 2 to find the moles of $Na_{2}O$
> $\frac{0.217}{2} = 0.1085$
> 	0.1085 Moles of $Na_{2}O$
> Find the mass of $Na_{2}O$
> 	$Moles \times M_{r} \downarrow$
> 	$0.1085 \times 62 = 6.727$
> **Answer to 3 s.f.**

# Conservation of Mass (3.5):

This is one of **<mark class="hltr-green">the most important concepts in GCSE chemistry</mark>**, it is the idea that no atoms are created or destroyed in a reaction and only the **bonds between atoms change**

>[!info] Example 
> This is shown in the reaction $$Na + Cl_{2} \to NaCl$$
>In order for this equation to make sense, we would need to <mark class="hltr-red">have two sodium chlorides</mark> as the product because we are inputting <mark class="hltr-orange">two chlorines</mark>. However, this would also mean we need <mark class="hltr-blue">two sodium</mark> in order for the equation to be balanced. Making the equation: $$2Na + Cl_{2} \to 2NaCl$$
>
>
>> [!tip] 
>> We are getting the same mass in and out, The $M_{r}$ of “$2Na$ and $Cl_{2}$” is 117. The $M_{r}$ of 2 Sodium Chloride is 117

# Atom Economy (3.8): 

When chemicals are made commercially, there will usually be multiple products. Some of these products will be waste products, and it is <mark class="hltr-green ">helpful to be able to quantify how much waste</mark> there is and how much useful product there is. It allows companies on an industrial scale, to know how much of the reactants are going to form an actual, useful product. This quantity is called **Atom Economy**, a reaction with a high atom economy is more efficient. ^Efficient-Reactions


>[!tip] Calculating Atom Economy
$$\text{Atom Economy} = \frac{{M_{r} \text{ of desired products}}}{{M_{r} \text{ of all desired products}}}$$


> [!NOTE]  Why is it important to consider atom economy? 
> There are **three** reasons: 
> 1. <mark class="hltr-red">Raw Material Cost:</mark> If here is a lower yield of useful product, more raw material is wasted: Making the process less profitable. 
> 2. <mark class="hltr-orange ">Sustainability:</mark> It is less sustainable to use a large amount of reactants only to produce little useful product 
> 3. <mark class="hltr-blue">Waste Products Disposal:</mark> A large amount of waste products may be expensive to get rid of, or detrimental to the environment.
