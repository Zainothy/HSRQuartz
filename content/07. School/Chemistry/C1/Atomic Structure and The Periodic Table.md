# Atoms and Ions: 

Everything is made up of tiny particles, known as atoms. They are so small that a cell contains trillions. 

> [!question] So what are Atoms? 
> An atom is made up of [[Subatomic Particles]],<mark class="hltr-blue">nucleus at the centre surrounded by electrons that orbit in rings called shells.</mark> The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. Protons and Neutrons have the same mass, meaning they both have a relative  mass of 1, however electrons weigh close to nothing and are just given a mass of 0. 
> > [!tip] Charges: 
> ><mark class="hltr-green"> Electrons are negatively charged</mark>, they have a relative charge of-1. <mark class="hltr-red">Protons are positively charged</mark> and have a relative charge of 1 and Neutrons are completely neutral, <mark class="hltr-pink">they have absolutely no charge. </mark>

Atoms have a radius of approximately 0.1nm, it is measured from the nucleus to the outer electron. However, this is mostly empty space.  Atoms are completely neutral, as the total charges cancel out; [[Ions]] are positive or negative, they are atoms that have gain or lost electrons to have a full outer shell, <mark class="hltr-green">see note to learn more</mark>

The formula of an atom or molecule can be expressed in text using [[Mollecular & Empirical Formulas]] (This is crossing into C2)
