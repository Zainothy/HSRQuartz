# The Poem itself: 
![[Ozymandias 2024-02-20 19.13.18.excalidraw]]


# Overview 

Ozymandias is written by one of [[The Romantics]], Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was written in 187, and was intended to be a dramatic monologue exploring the idea that all power is temporary, and that the passing of time will erase anything. 

# Context: 

> [!tip] Shelley’s Political Views:
> Percy Shelley was a radical of his time, he was incredibly critical of them monarchy and did not believe it to be necessary, he felt that the rule of that time: King George II had overstayed his welcome. He restricts the perspective of the poem to that of a traveller, so he could use Ozymandias as an allegory for George II without attributing these views to him. 

# The Writer’s Methods: 

# Form: 

- The poem is a <mark class="hltr-green">14 line form of Petrarchan sonnet</mark>, but it uses a different rhyming scheme and iambic pentameter. This is often seen more in Shakespearean sonnets.
	- The irregular rhyme scheme is meant to <mark class="hltr-purple">highlight the denial of tradition</mark> and giving way to new power.
- The poem is written as a <mark class="hltr-pink">sonnet: a structure typically used for love poems.</mark> It was likely done like this to show Ozymandias’ love for himself and his arrogance. 

# Structure: 

- <mark class="hltr-blue">Shelley uses caesura in line three</mark>, caesura is the pause that occurs on a line, marked by an ellipsis 
	- This technique, causes the sonnet to come to a sudden halt in the middle of the line: creates suspense 
	- Shelley uses caesura to represent the broken nature of the statue 
- Enjambment is used alongside caesura to create an uneven pattern that reflects the broken nature of the statue, and to highlight the fact that nothing lasts forever. 
# Language: 

**The language Shelley uses is engineered to communicated the futile nature of human power and the everlasting control that nature has over humanity**

- The<mark class="hltr-yellow"> statue is seen as a representation of human power</mark>: it is an attempt at immortalisation and yet it crumbles under the passing of time. Nothing but a “Colossal Wreck” remain, creating a sense of irony. 
- <mark class="hltr-red">The “sneer of cold command” reflects corruption and arrogance</mark>: This reflect Shelley’s anti-military views, he was against violent, “cold command” of  action
- “Look on my works” is used to create a sense of irony, none of Ozymandias’ works remain to this day 
- The<mark class="hltr-blue"> desert setting is symbolic</mark>: the land that surrounds the statue is a barren, vast and featureless wasteland without life or culture
	- “Boundless and bare”: communicates the vast and powerful reach of nature, and how it outlives all 
- <mark class="hltr-green">Alliteration:</mark> “lone and level”: emphatic of the vast, unending nature of the desert and contrasts the feeble power of man
