# Women & Children during the [[Industrial Revolution]]: 
>[!tip] Attitudes to Children in the 1800s: 
>- Attitudes were incredibly different in this time period, children were meant to be ‘seen and not heard’ and treat adults with the utmost respect. Many people believed that kids that didn’t withhold to this were deserving of corporal punishment
>- Children often died during childhood, Pip had five dead brothers: this was seen as typical during this period
>- Families from a working class background that were short on money were expected to put their kids to work, some worked in factories and others did jobs in the fields. 
>>[!info] How this Relates to Dickens’ background: 
>>When Dickens was twelve, he had to give up his education and work in a factory for a while. He eventually returned to school, however he never forgot his factory experience.

## Education: 
- During the 1800s, Education was often only available to those of the upper class, which meant that there was a lack of social mobility and a high amount of illiterate people. 
	- Up to 50% of the population during this time period did not know how to read or write 
- The education that was offered to the working classes was subpar and lacking, local schools only taught basic reading, writing and maths. Nothing else. 
- Some local schools were run by The Church, others may have been run by women in their own homes: these were known as Dame Schools, Pip went to one. Sometimes, older students would help out with teaching, Biddy being an example. 
- **Children from richer families had more [[Social identity theory|social mobility]] and ready access to high quality education, things like tuition or governess’. Who would teach them at home to help them get ahead.**
	- For example, Pip is taught by Mr Pocket. 

## Expectations for Women: 
>[!context] Estella 
>Estella’s marriage to Bentley Drummle highlights the risks that women are forced to take during marriage in this time period. Drummle provides wealth, security and independence from Ms Havisham, but he also treats her with ‘great cruelty’: making her incredibly unhappy. 
>

- People believed that a woman’s place in society was completely domestic, married women had no legal rights and all of their property was considered their husbands property 
- Marriage was still seen as better than being an “old maid”: this is because of the lack of jobs for women in this society. Marriage provided women with security and independence from their family, and was seen as the best choice for women
- Charles Dickens had very conventional views on [[Gender role|gender roles]], however he always portrayed the ‘lovable’ women in the novel as quiet and ‘well-behaved’. 
# Class and [[Social identity theory]]
- Social class identity was a key part of society in the 1800s, there was no [[Social mobility]]. Your class would completely dictate quality of life. 
- Manners were associated with a higher [[Social class|social class]], they existed to prove that you were a member of the higher class. Along with this, table manners existed to add a social element to meals. This is why Herbert gives pip ‘friendly suggestions’ on how to act at the dinner table 
- Along with this, the middle and upper classes were expected to speak with proper diction, befitting of that of the regional accent. Joe is unable to do this, which is one of the main contributors to his awkward behaviour around Ms Havisham
