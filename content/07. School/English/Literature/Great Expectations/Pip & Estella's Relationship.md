# Relationships in The Novel: 
One of the major messages in Great Expectations is that relationships are the most important aspect of life. Characters in the novel that know this are able to live in a happy life. 

>[!info] Examples: 
>- Joe loves Pip like a son, despite the fact they aren’t blood related. Biddy takes on the role of caring for and teaching pip, she loves him: even though pip will take her for granted. As a result of this, Biddy and Joe eventually get married and live a happy, content life. 
>	- Pip tells Joe that  Biddy will make him ‘as happy as even you deserve to be’. 
>- Herbert decides to marry Clara, despite his families distaste towards her. They build a happy life together, and Herbert is content 
>- Wemmick is a loyal friend to Pip and treats his father with immense amounts of respect, he ends up happily married to Miss Skiffins. 

### Pip’s Loyalty to Estella: 
- Pip meeting Estella was a significant turning point in his life, it was what caused him to question his working class background and made him want to change it. 
	- He grew unhappy with his ‘coarse hands’ and ‘thick boots’, as pointed out by Estella. This plants the seed for Pip’s obsession with [[Social class|social class]]. 
- Pip’s relationship with Estella later blinds his judgement, it stops him from realising Biddy’s love for him and he fails to notice how happy he may be with her. 
- His loyalty pays off when the two end up friends, however the reader is left questioning whether it was worth it, and what really happened to them in the end.

>[!tip] 8-9 Targeted info
>In the novel, failed relationships are often limited to darkness. For example, the light is ‘completely excluded’ from the room where Miss Havisham’s wedding feast was meant to take place, as a result of this: Estella gets used to being raised in ‘Dark confinement’. In contrast to this, when Pip & Estella are reconciled. They are described as surrounded by a “tranquil light”. This can be interpreted as a hint towards a more productive and positive and productive relationship between the two in the future.
