# How Dickens Presents Magwitch: 

Throughout the novel, Dickens uses numerous methods to present Magwitch as a pitiful character. One way that he does is through Pip’s feelings and behaviour. Pip feels the need to help him because he pities Magwitch, this immediately establishes him as a pitiful character to the reader. This is shown in the extract with the quote *‘Pitying his desolation… I made bold to say “I’m glad you enjoyed it”’*. At the beginning of the novel this establishes to the reader that Pip is an empathetic character that, and pities the situation that Magwitch is in. This gives us an idea of who Pip is, and establishes to the reader the nature of Magwitch’s character. 

Another way that dickens portrays [[Character Profiles|Magwitch]] as pitiful is through comparison. In the novel Magwitch’s behaviour and body language is compared with pitiful creatures and there is often a disparity between Pip and Magwitch in terms of power. This is shown in the quote from the extract where Pip compares him with a dog: *‘I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I now noticed a decided similarity between the dog's way of eating, and the man's.’*. I believe Dickens use’s this comparison to make it clear to the reader that Magwitch is a character of pitiful nature. I think he does this by comparing the way that he eats to that of a dog, the way a dog eats often being associated with timidity and lack of power. 

Outside of the extract, one way Dickens shows that Magwitch is pitiful: is through his obsession over Pip, during Part three of the novel. It is revealed to Pip that Magwitch is the benefactor, in this part of the novel. Pip finds himself quite worried and anxious, unsettled by Magwitch’s obsessive behaviour around him. The fact that a single instance for him led [[Character Profiles|Magwitch]] to dedicate his entire life to Pip. This is shown in the quote: *’The abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the repugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded if he had been some terrible beast.’*. I believe that this obsessive behaviour is used to communicate to the reader how pathetic Magwitch was, he latched onto Pip and developed an unhealthy obsession. This behaviour is almost pitiful, further emphasising the pathetic/pitiful nature of Magwitch.

A final way that Magwitch is presented as pitiful is through his dependence on Pip throughout the story. He is constantly finding himself in situations where he has to rely on Pip for his survival due to his background as a convicted felon. This is shown at points in the story like when he asks pip for ‘whittles’ or when he relies on Pip to keep him safe from being executed. This sense of dependence on Pip creates a disparity in power between the two and further emphasises how pathetic of a character Magwitch can be. 

In conclusion, Dickens is able to portray Magwitch as a pitiful and pathetic character through methods such as: Pip’s internal monologue, his behaviour in the novel and the language used in relation to him. I believe Dickens chose to give Magwitch this dependent, sad portrayal to highlight the injustice and separation from society that convicts had to face during this time period.
