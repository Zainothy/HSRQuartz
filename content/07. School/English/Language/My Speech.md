# The Problems it Causes} 
Please do not be overly verbose in this, as we want to keep the audience engaged for the
 start

Now, more than ever: we are seeing a rise in social division on a large scale. People increasingly see themselves as members of opposing teams in so many aspects of life. One of the most influential reasons is social media: it is seen as something that divides us, destroys our sense of empathy and is a breeding ground for toxicity and hatred. A study conducted by a market research company in September of 2023 found that 67% of people are made victims of hate speech online and  85% of users expressed concern around a rise in disinformation[^2]. 

This makes it evident that social media poses a challenge to how we interact with information and people unlike any other challenge we have faced before. Never has misinformation and hate speech been so abundant so that the majority of people could say they feel worried about it.  It is imperative that we  push for governmental intervention on how social media must operate, and that we look for mitigation around the issues it may pose to our society.
# Simple Breakdown

To do that, we need to get to the root of why social media causes social division so we can properly gain an understanding of what to do to make it a better place for all.

It is commonly suggested that social media acts as an echo chamber for world views and opinions: this holds merit, as algorithms are typically designed to show “relevant” content to the user. However, anyone who uses social media will know that we can see a plethora of different, diverse opinions. In fact: a social sciences research paper published in 2022[^3] analyses how digital media drive affects polarisation, and it came to the conclusion that digital media encourages interaction outside of our ideological “bubble”, which can further increase social and political division.

This is made worse in countries that follow a two party system, like the United States: or a country with only two major parties, like the UK, as it causes conflicting political views to be seen as direct opposition to yours. A recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre (an American think tank) across 19 countries shows that the majority see strong partisan conflicts in their society, with over 44% believing that there is strong political tension in the UK.[^1]

# The Real Echo Chamber 
In our everyday lives, the individuals we tend to interact with typically share similar backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Our neighbours, friends, family: are all more likely to hold similar beliefs or principles. Even when there are conflicts between you, you could still relate to them because of your background. This shared familiarity creates a subconscious sense of understanding and connection, and while the  way we operate socially may work fine for us on a community level, it becomes a great challenge in our globalised world. 

The anonymity of online interactions can make it difficult for us to relate to those with conflicting views. Without the personal connection or shared experiences that we have with[^4] people in our immediate circles, we may subconsciously dismiss or invalidate their opinions. When we feel negatively towards someone, it may also cause us to be less critical of negative things we hear about them - less critical thought leads to more blind belief of information, which contributes to the spread of misinformation. 

This subconscious tendency to socially sort people based on their world views can lead to us focusing solely on disagreements, which fragments online relationships and limits social cohesion. This strong emphasis that we put on disagreements withers at the potential for constructive conversations and collaboration, these things are essential for a well-structured society.**
# Mitigation and Blame 

**So, what can we do:**
Well, it is important to take a more critical approach to yourself: we can’t change the world, but if we all try to change ourselves, we are a step closer to doing so. How have you managed to form your views on the world? Do you dismiss information with a bias towards who is stating that information? Clearly, it is imperative that in the information era we live in, that we are as neutrally critical as possible towards content we see online: if we are too positively or negatively biased towards the content we consume, then misinformation and lack of critical thought runs wild. 

**However, it can’t be all our faults, can it?**
If we look back on a pre-social media internet, there were no algorithmic suggestions or platforms fighting to keep you engaged. The pre-social media internet was much more fractured and decentralised, everything had a communal aspect to it: with threads, forums and bulletins all kept separate from each other. Every site, thread, forum, etc. had its own rules and structure: some would have strict rules and others would be much more lenient. There would be a place where everyone fits, there was no centralised place for everyone to gather, it was all encased in different pockets. This is incredibly similar to the communal aspects that you would see in real life, like in a village or town. 
  
It is now vital that we look at what is wrong with the way the internet is run in the modern day, and how it can be improved: one massive issue is algorithmic content suggestions and feeds: these systems are put in place purely to keep us engaged with the platform as long as possible and are not created to nurture an actual interest, but to nurture an addiction.   

Combating this comes down to banning or regulating how these systems are used, enforcing transparency within them and allowing full user control over how they run. Along with this, governmental investment in digital literacy education, will further enhance our understanding of online social dynamics and empower us to navigate digital landscapes responsibly. This will improve user agency, transparency, and informed decision-making, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and empowering online environment.**
